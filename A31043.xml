            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough I have of late wholly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted my ſelf to the Study of Practical <hi>Theology,</hi> and ſpent all that time I could redeem from my neceſſary occaſions, in Reading ſuch Authors as make it their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to declare unto us the eſſentials of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; yet it hath been ſome delight to me, from time to time, by your Letters, to underſtand what Books have been Printed about thoſe (comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) Petit controverſies that have of late years ſo miſerably divided our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches. I heartily wiſh, you had ſtill continued only to be my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencer, then I had been at liberty, either not to ſend for the Authors you mentioned, or elſe when I had ſent for them, to lay them aſide as ſoon I had enough of them: but you were am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to be my Benefactor, and therefore lately ſent me at your own coſt Mr. <hi>Durells</hi> two Eriſtical Volumes, conjuring me, by all our friendſhip, to read them over, and to return you my thoughts
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105061:3"/>of them: and though I have again and again im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned you to excuſe me from ſo unwelcome an employment, yet will you take no denial; wherefore that I may not ſeem finally obſtinate, I do, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ſend you ſome Animadverſions, the fruit of a few leiſure hours; in reading whereof, if you either encreaſe the itch of diſputation, or be forced to abate of the eſteem you as yet have of your Author, you know where to lay the blame. I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, I envy not unto him the Eccleſiaſtical dignities and benefices he enjoys: but I think he was as unmeet a perſon, as any could have been pitched on, to undertake the Cauſe of our Church, againſt the Nonconforming Miniſters: for the grounds of this ſo ſevere cenſure, I refer you to what follows, and at preſent ſhall only lay before you three or four neceſſary qualifications of him that would plead for conformity with any ſucceſs, or credit to our Church.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He had need to be free from all ſuſpition of ambition, and of that, which the Apoſtle calls, <hi>the root of all evil;</hi> elſe his adverſaries will ſay, that in his pleadings for the Church, he ſeeks not <hi>her,</hi> but <hi>hers.</hi> The Writings of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sprint,</hi> Dr. <hi>Burges,</hi> as they are in themſelves ſober, and learned, ſo they are by all, or moſt, read with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice: becauſe they contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch ordinary preferments, as they either had before they had written, or might have expected though they had never written for Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. Nay Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> profeſſeth, <hi>that he loſt more by conforming, than any did by not conforming,</hi> (by the way, whereas Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> ſaith <hi>Hiſt.</hi> of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105061:3"/>
               <hi>Presby.</hi> Pag. 327. <hi>That King</hi> James <hi>occaſioned this Doctors preferring to the Rectory of Colſhill in War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickſhire:</hi> the Reader may take notice that he was never Rector of <hi>Colſhill,</hi> but of <hi>Sutton Goldfield,</hi> unto which the King occaſioned not his preferment, for the preſentation was given him without his ſeeking, by Mr. <hi>Shilton,</hi> after it had been firſt refuſed by Dr. <hi>Chetwind</hi>); I therefore doubt not but he did write for the lawfulneſs of Subſcription, out of conſcience, and that he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in that opinion, though Authority had frowned upon it.</p>
            <p>I dare not ſay ſo much concerning all that were, or would have been, more highly dignified. The firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> man that grated hard upon the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Government in the Latin tongue, was Dr. <hi>Matthew Suttliffe,</hi> Dean of <hi>Exeter,</hi> in a Book entituled <hi>de verâ, Catholicâ &amp; Chriſtianâ, Eccleſiâ,</hi> this very man, whether diſcontented, becauſe his Book againſt Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> was ſuppreſſed; or angry that he miſſed ſome preferment he aimed at, or for ſome other reaſons we know not of, before his death, profeſſed his hearty ſorrow that <hi>he had written ſo much againſt Presbytery and for the power of the domineering Prelates,</hi> as may be ſeen in the <hi>Jus divinum Regiminis Eccleſiaſtici.</hi> Who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed a greater zeal for Hierarchy than <hi>Patrick Adamſon?</hi> But Hierarchy not being able to pay its quarters in the worlds own coin, how poorly did he Recant all his actings for it? <hi>Confeſſing Presbyteries to be an ordinance of Chriſt, and craving Gods mercy that he had called them a fooliſh inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; bewailing his pride and covetouſneſs that had put
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105061:4"/>him upon undertaking the office of an Archbiſhop, as that wherewith juſtly the ſincereſt profeſſors of the word have found fault, and condemned as impertinent to the office of a ſincere paſtor of Gods word; ingaging alſo that if he had health, he would write a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of</hi> Sutliffes <hi>Book.</hi> All which, and much more, is to be found in the Records of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He that would, with any advantage to the Church, undertake to confute <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> muſt be one <hi>that hath ſeen and well conſidered, either all, or the chiefeſt of their Books, and well knows the Hiſtories of the times in which they were written.</hi> Elſe, firſt he may commit ſuch foul miſtakes in Chronology, as will render him ridiculous and contemptible to all his Readers. Can the moſt mortified <hi>Presbyterian</hi> chuſe but laugh, when he finds in Dr. <hi>Heylins</hi> Hiſtory of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> Pag. 264, <hi>that about</hi> 1570. Mr. <hi>Carthwrights grace for Doctor was denied him, by the major part of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity; which ſo diſpleaſed him, and his adherents, that, from that time, the degrees of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Batchelors, and Maſters, were eſteemed unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and thoſe that took them reckoned for the limbs of Antichriſt, as appears by the Genevian notes on the Revelations.</hi> How can it appear from the <hi>Geneva</hi> notes, that from the time of denying Mr. <hi>Carth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights</hi> grace, degrees were accounted unlawful? when every one knows, that many years before the denial of that grace, thoſe notes had been both made, and publiſhed, perhaps by ſuch as never ſaw or heard of Mr. <hi>Carthwright:</hi> Nor is that leſs ridiculous which occurs, <hi>Pag.</hi> 294. where
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105061:4"/>mention being made of a Pamphlet written by <hi>Stubbes</hi> of <hi>Lincolns-Inne,</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>Stubbes had married one of Mr.</hi> Carthwrights <hi>Siſters, and therefore may be thought to have done nothing without his privity.</hi> Mr. <hi>Carthwright</hi> indeed married one of Mr. <hi>Stubbes</hi> his Siſters, but that Mr. <hi>Stubbes</hi> married one of his Siſters is a falſhood; and if it were ſuppoſed to be a truth, what ground is that, why a man ſhould think that <hi>Stubbes</hi> did nothing without his privity? Do all writers make their Brothers-in-law privy to their deſigns? I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that <hi>Thuanus</hi> ſaith <hi>it was found out that Mr.</hi> Carthwright <hi>inſtigated him to write the Libel;</hi> but <hi>Thuanus</hi> is not to be relied on in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to the <hi>Engliſh Puritans,</hi> becauſe in ſuch, he follows one who was their bitter adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; as alſo becauſe <hi>Thuanus</hi> himſelf was too too Antipuritanical, perfectly in Religion of the ſame mind with <hi>Caſſander</hi> and <hi>Baldwin,</hi> whoſe Character need not be given. Doubtleſs had there been either clear proof, or vehement ſuſpition, that Mr. <hi>Carthwright</hi> was acceſſary to the compiling of the <hi>gaping Gulph,</hi> he had not eſcaped ſome ſignal token of the Queens diſpleaſure; for her Majeſty was ſo highly incenſed againſt the Author, Printer, and Publiſher of it, that nothing leſs would ſatisfie her, than arraignment of them <hi>upon the Statute of</hi> Philip <hi>and</hi> Mary, <hi>againſt the Authors and Diſperſers of ſeditious writings;</hi> and becauſe ſome of her chief Lawyers were of opinion, That that law was but temporary, and of no force in her reign, ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoneth one of them, and turns another out of his place, and prevailed ſo far, that both <hi>Stubbes,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105061:5"/>and <hi>Page</hi> (who diſperſed the Copies) had ſentence paſſed upon them, to loſe their right hands: which accordingly were cut off in the market-place of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> with a Butchers knife and a Mallet; but it is obſerved by more than one of our Hiſtorians, that when <hi>Stubbes</hi> his right hand was cut off, he did pull off his Hat with his left hand, and cry out, <hi>God ſave the Queen:</hi> and the people by a general ſilence gave their Teſtimony, that the puniſhment was too ſevere. Nor did the Queen her ſelf take much pleaſure in reflecting on this penalty, but rather when the heat of paſſion was over, received <hi>Stubbes</hi> into ſome degree of favour, as is probable from the imployment that he had under <hi>Peregrine</hi> Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> ſent by the Queen with four thouſand Soldiers to aſſiſt the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> in which imployment he ended his days, but by a natural death.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if our Writers for Conformity know not the State of the controverſies, and the times, in which they were managed, they will go near to contradict one another; and will it not make the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> good ſport, to ſee their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries at diſſenſion among themſelves? Could Mr. <hi>Durells Engliſh</hi> Book have been more effectually confuted by any writing, than by Dr. <hi>Heylins</hi> Hiſtory of <hi>Presbyterians?</hi> Dr. <hi>Stradling</hi> licenſeth a Book tending to prove that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>England</hi> are a ſingular ſort of men, as contrary to the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> beyond the Seas, as to their own Biſhops at home; the Vicechancellor of <hi>Oxford</hi> licenſeth a Book deſigned to prove that all <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> all the reformed Churches over, are all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105061:5"/>acted by one ſpirit, equally prone to ſedition and ſchiſme, alike bent to deſtroy all Kingdoms and Churches into which they are received. Will not the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ſay <hi>Aha! ſo would we have it?</hi> will they not even bleſs themſelves in theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions of their adverſaries? Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Pag.</hi> 275. <q>
                  <hi>Whitgift</hi> diſſected <hi>Carth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights</hi> admonition, in a Book entituled, An anſwer to the Admonition. <hi>Carthwright</hi> ſets out a reply in the year following, and <hi>Whitgift</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently rejoyns in defence of his Anſwer; againſt which <hi>Carthwright</hi> never ſtirred, but left him Maſter of the field, poſſeſt of all the ſigns of an abſolute Victory. But Sir <hi>George Paul</hi> ſaith, Mr. <hi>Carthwright</hi> (glorying be-like to have the laſt word) publiſhed a ſecond reply, fraught with no other ſtuff than had been before refuted, from anſwering of which <hi>Whitgift</hi> was diſſwaded.</q> Will not ſuch ſweet concord as this, make delicate Muſick in the ears of the <hi>Nonconformiſts?</hi> Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering that the Letter of <hi>Whitaker</hi> mentioned by the Doctor, is pretended by the Knight to be one of the main inducements moving <hi>Whitgift</hi> not to rejoyn to the ſecond reply. And let me admoniſh the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> not much to glory in <hi>Whitakers</hi> letter, reflecting ſo much diſgrace on <hi>Carthwrights</hi> Book, ſeeing <hi>Whitaker</hi> was then, 1. Under thirty years of age. 2. Never dreamed that his Letter ſhould be made publick. 3. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards married the Widow of <hi>Dudly Fennor.</hi> 4. In thoſe writings which were the product and iſſue of his more mature judgment and ſtudy, layeth down ſuch principles as the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> think
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105061:6"/>their concluſions do naturally and lineally deſcend from. 5. Died in over-ſtraining his diligence to ſuppreſs the <hi>Pelagian</hi> notions of <hi>Peter Baro,</hi> ſo much now-adays applauded and admired. Certainly if they are to be accounted Victors who keep the field laſt, the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> have at leaſt as many Victors as the <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> though we ſhould grant that <hi>Whitgift</hi> had the laſt word of <hi>Carthwright,</hi> which yet is not to be granted. But doth not Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> ſay in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, he had? Anſwer, He doth; but I have been aſſured, <hi>that being before Olivers triers for a living, he ingenuouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his error, and promiſed to certifie it, if ever his Book came to a ſecond Edition,</hi> which I therefore give notice of, that it may proceed no further, and that Mr. <hi>Iſaac Walton,</hi> who is ſtill alive, and hath fallen into the ſame miſtake in his life of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> Pag. 85. may diſabuſe his Reader. The which if he will vouchſafe to do, we ſhall have encouragement to try, whether we cannot acquaint him with ſome more of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, and miſadventures. In the mean time I ſhould be glad to underſtand, what aſſurance can be given us, that Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> ever uſed ſuch words concerning <hi>Carthwright</hi> as thoſe mentioned by Dr. <hi>Heylin.</hi> Lib. 7. Pag. 274. and elſewhere, <hi>viz.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105061:6"/>All that I can ſee any ground to acknowledg, at preſent, is but this, that <hi>Jewel</hi> both in a Sermon at <hi>Paul's,</hi> and in a conference with ſome Brethren, had declared himſelf to be an approver of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> ceremonies; and that being ready to leave the world, he declared <hi>that what he uttered in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and conference, was deſigned neither to pleaſe any mortal, nor to embitter or trouble any party that thought otherwiſe than himſelf; but that neither party might prejudg the other, and that the love of God by the Holy ſpirit which is given to us, might be poured forth in the hearts of brethren.</hi> See his life written by the <hi>Nonconforming</hi> Dr. <hi>Humpred.</hi> Pag. 255. <hi>edit.

And then they may alſo conſider whether he hath not erred in dating <hi>Zanchies</hi> Letter to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> September the ſecond; for in my edition of <hi>Zanchies</hi> Letters put forth by his Heirs at <hi>Hannouae</hi> 1609. it bears date the tenth of <hi>September,</hi> 1571. Theſe are ſmall matters, it will be ſaid; I confeſs they be; but if men will write Hiſtories, they ought to be very exact, and publiſh nothing that need fear the ſevereſt examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Let me be excuſed if I here adventure to give two more inſtances, one of Dr. <hi>Heylins</hi> imaginary Victories; the other of his contrariety to other writers whom he ſometimes quotes with applauſe. <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Pag.</hi> 283. He acquaints us <hi>that Dr.</hi> Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft <hi>made a moſt excellent and judicious Sermon</hi> (let
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105061:7"/>that paſs) he gives us the heads of that Sermon, ſaying, <hi>pag.</hi> 284, <hi>That they were all proved with ſuch evidence of demonſtration, ſuch great variety of Learning, and strength of arguments, that none of all that party could be found to take arms againſt them in defence either of their leud doctrine, or more ſcandalous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</hi> All this with bitterneſs and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice more than enough; but with no regard to truth: for Dr. <hi>John Reynolds</hi> at the deſire of Sir <hi>Francis Knowles,</hi> did attaque that ſo much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded Sermon of <hi>Feb. 9th.</hi> at St. <hi>Pauls Croſs,</hi> and pulled down two of the main pillars, <hi>viz. The ſuperiority which Biſhops have among us over their Clergy, is Gods own ordinance.</hi> 2.

Let thoſe who account Dr. <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crofts</hi> Sermon unanſwerable, reply to Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> his Letter, and if it be thought that Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> hath not refuted all the paſſages of the Sermon, let us know what the particulars be that ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unanſwered, and yet need an anſwer, and if after ſuch notice given, ſuch terror ſeize on <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> that none dare appear, let the Sermon then be carried about in triumph; till then I hope it will be no preſumption to ſay, that Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> as well underſtood the judgment of the Fathers, concerning Epiſcopacy, as Dr. <hi>Bancroft.</hi>

            <p>The inſtance of his contradicting others, ſhall be part of the ſtory concerning the infamous ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſt <hi>Browne:</hi> Sir <hi>George Paul</hi> in the life of Archbiſhop <hi>VVhitgift,</hi> Pag. 53, acquaints us, <hi>that</hi> Brown <hi>in the Archbiſhops time was changed from his fancies, and after obtained a benefice called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church in</hi> Northamptonſhire <hi>where he became a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Preacher.</hi> But Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> Lib. 7. Pag. 297. tells us, <hi>he was prevailed with to accept a place, Achurch in</hi> Northamptonſhire, <hi>beneficed with cure of Souls; a benefice of good value, which might tempt him to it the rather, in regard that he was excuſed as well from Preaching as from performing any other part of the publick Miniſtry.</hi> Certainly, if he became a painful Preacher, there was no need of excuſing him from Preaching.</p>
            <p>But who is in the truth? I think neither the Knight nor the Doctor; painful Preacher to be ſure <hi>Brown</hi> never was, after his preſentation to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church;</hi> nor is it probable that he was excuſed from Preaching, any more than from living quietly with his Wife. Biſhops have ſtrained their power very high, but I am unwilling to believe that any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſince our Reformation would inſtitute a man healthful and able to Preach, into a cure of Souls, and yet excuſe him from all parts of the publick Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Nay, thirdly, If men take the field againſt the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> before they have ſufficiently tried their ſtrength, they may chance to be maſtered by theſe arguments they imagined themſelves able to maſter; and ſo even face about in the day of battel, fighting againſt thoſe from whom they received
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105061:8"/>their firſt pay. Mr. <hi>Henry Jeanes</hi> had never ſeen a <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> uſing his own weapon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought him contemptible, and adventured to defie him in a Printed Treatiſe upon 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.22. But when he came to Read the very Books of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> themſelves, he found himſelf no longer able to withſtand the dint of their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but went over to them, and died their Convert, as all know who were his Neighbour Miniſters: ſome <hi>Papiſts</hi> by reading Proteſtant Books, with an intent to confute them, have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by them; and therefore the Grandees in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, will not give leave to one of a thouſand, to Read all manner of Books; nay in ſome places they will ſcarcely permit <hi>Bellarmines</hi> works to be commonly ſold, leſt that little which is in them of <hi>Calvin</hi> ſhould purge all <hi>Catholociſm</hi> out of their young Students. I wiſh the Prelates of our Church would conſider how far the prudence of <hi>Papacy</hi> is imitable; certainly every one who is willing to have a Prebendſhip from them, is not able to ſtand under the weight and burden that is laid upon <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi> If our Church muſt be vindicated, let it be vindicated by another <hi>Hooker,</hi> made up of learning and modeſty; as for Mr. <hi>Durel,</hi> if he have got a <hi>lask,</hi> and muſt needs eaſe himſelf in the Preſs, it may be worth conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether he be not fit to ſucceed to <hi>Tom Naſh,</hi> whoſe ſcoffing Pen was not altogether uſeleſs in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt added, that he who will to purpoſe defend our Church, muſt not be a <hi>Jerſey</hi> man; not only, becauſe ſuch a one can ſcarce be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105061:8"/>ſully to know the intrigues of our differences; but alſo becauſe it can ſcarce be thought, that he ſhould be conſcientiouſly a friend to our Hierarchy: for we are not now to be told, that the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Government ſetled here in <hi>England,</hi> could not get into <hi>Jerſey,</hi> but by wile, if not force. <hi>Jerſey, Guernſey,</hi> &amp;c. are the only remainders of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> in the Dukedom of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and in former times belonged to the Juriſdiction of the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> but were governed immediately by a ſubordinate Officer mixt of a Chancelor and Archdeacon; they entertained the Reformed Religion in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, and ſome of their Inhabitants ſuffered for it in the time of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> reigning, by the help of ſome <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, the generality were again brought to ſeek after Reformation; but withall Petition the Queen for an allowance of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Diſcipline, <hi>Anno</hi> 1563; and <hi>Anno</hi> 1565, obtain it for all, or ſome part of the <hi>Iſlands:</hi> on which allowance they adventure to put it in execution, and hold a <hi>Synod</hi> in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Guernſey,</hi> Sep. 2. 1567. Nor do I find that they had any conſiderable diſturbance in it, till Sir <hi>John Peiton</hi> was made their Governour, who with the Kings Attorney proteſted againſt that choice of Mr. <hi>Brevin,</hi> which was made by the Colloquy, upon the deceaſe of the Curate of St. <hi>Johns:</hi> the ground of the Proteſtation was the prejudicialneſs of ſuch Elections to the Rights and Profits of the King, deprived thereby of <hi>Vacancies,</hi> and <hi>firſt Fruits.</hi> This Proteſtation, though over-ruled for a ſeaſon, wrought ſo effectually, that about 1615,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105061:9"/>the Governour preſented one Mr. <hi>Meſſering</hi> to the Pariſh of St. <hi>Peters;</hi> this <hi>Meſſering</hi> had been ordained Prieſt by Dr. <hi>Bridges</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> but his preſentation was ſo offenſive to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy, that Governour and Miniſters appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore King <hi>James,</hi> referring the whole concernment to his Majeſties final Judgment; and the Miniſters for ought I find, had continued in <hi>Statu quo,</hi> had they been unanimous; but Monſieur <hi>De la Place</hi> being brought into a golden dream, that if a Dean were again eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Iſle,</hi> he, and no other ſhould be the man, betrayed his brethren, and violated the Oath he had before taken, ſo as it was at length ordered by the Council of <hi>England,</hi> That <hi>an Officer inveſted with the authority of the ancient Dean, ſhould again be eſtabliſhed in the</hi> Iſle <hi>of</hi> Jerſey, <hi>and that the Biſhop of</hi> Wincheſter <hi>ſhould by Commiſſion under his ſeal give authority unto the ſaid Dean, to exerciſe Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction in the ſaid</hi> Iſle: but not Monſieur <hi>Place,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Bandinel,</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> is put into the Deanery; which Mr. <hi>Places</hi> high ſtomack not digeſting, he retires into <hi>Guernſey,</hi> breathing out nothing but diſgrace to the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy,</hi> and the Change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made in <hi>Jerſey,</hi> by his own Treachery. The ſum of all is: <hi>The Iſlanders of</hi> Jerſey <hi>had the</hi> Engliſh Liturgy <hi>tranſlated into their own Language in the reign of King</hi> Edward <hi>the ſixth; in Queen</hi> Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths <hi>reign, they forſook it, aeſired the</hi> Presbyterial <hi>diſcipline, and by Oath bound themſelves to keep and obſerve it. The</hi> Epiſcopal <hi>Government was obtruded upon them, through the perjury of an Ambitious Miniſter who declaimed againſt it as ſoon as he ſaw he could
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105061:9"/>not ſerve his own ends by it.</hi> Doth any Law oblige us to believe that any Natives of this Iſle heartily embrace it? I think it will be no uncharitableneſs to ſay—<hi>Timeo Danaos, &amp; dona ferentes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A fourth qualification required in him that will go a warfare for our Church, is a good knowledg of all the rules and forms of Argumentation; he that wants ſuch knowledg, will no more be able to manage the Churches Arguments, than <hi>David</hi> was to uſe <hi>Sauls</hi> Armor; nay, he will be a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block and ſtone of offence to our young ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. When Dr. <hi>Heylin's Certamen Epistolare</hi> came abroad, I had ſpent Three years and no more at <hi>Cambridg;</hi> yet I muſt needs buy the Book, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Author was famed for his Geography, and had been repreſented to me as a very living Library; thought I,
<q>Si pergama dextra Defendi poſſent, certe hac defenſa videbo.</q> But reading his Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I found my ſelf quite fruſtrated in my expectation; for whereas Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had made a conditional Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm, and inſtead of aſſuming the words of the antecedent at large, had uſed an allowed brevity, <hi>But the antecedent is true:</hi> The Dr. tells him Page 80. <hi>That it was a ſtrange piece of news</hi> to him, to read any one making uſe of that brief form of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Syllogiſm. This ſtartled me, for I was ſure that almoſt every Syſtem of Logick, that fell into the mention of conditional Syllogiſms, not only allowed, but commended it to us, for brevity
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105061:10"/>ſake, after a conditional <hi>major</hi> to proceed thus, <hi>But the Antecedent is true,</hi> Ergo, <hi>ſo is the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent;</hi> or, <hi>but the Conſequent is falſe,</hi> Ergo, <hi>ſo is the Antecedent:</hi> I was as ſure that thoſe School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (in whoſe Logicks and Metaphyſicks I had waſted too much time) did uſually ſo argue, and I had read that long before them, the Stoicks were much pleaſed with this form of Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and called it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; how then (ſaid I within my ſelf) comes it to paſs, that an ancient Dr. in Divinity, who hath combated not only <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> but alſo Biſhops and Heads of Houſes, and ſometimes nibbles at <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf, ſhould upon the reading of ſuch a Syllogiſm fall into ſuch a fit of admiration? What Anſwer I gave my ſelf, is not material; but I reſolved to lay aſide my opinion of the Doctors abilities; but rather to hope that he would make known ſome myſtery that was bid from <hi>Duncan, Burgeſdicius, Iſendorne, &amp;c.</hi> till I came to his 8, Page, where I met with theſe words, <hi>The Antecedent in all Hypothetical propoſitions being conditional, imperfect, and of no full ſenſe, cannot be ſaid to be either true or falſe.</hi> When I had read them, I then concluded the Dr. was void of all rational learning, and perhaps did not know what <hi>hypothetical</hi> ſignified; for certainly every hypothetical Propoſition is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Propoſition; and if it be compound, it muſt conſiſt of Two Propoſitions, and one of thoſe Propoſitions muſt needs be the Antecedent: Now if the Antecedent be a Propoſition, it muſt needs be either true or falſe. I know that ſometimes the Antecedent, as well as the Conſequent, is not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105061:10"/>formally a Propoſition; but it's evermore, at leaſt virtually a Propoſition, and therefore may be ſaid to be true or falſe; if it could not, why do our Logicks ſo carefully tell us, <hi>that we muſt not eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the verity or falſity of a conditional, from the verity or falſity of its parts, but from the true or falſe connexion that is betwixt them?</hi> It were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly needleſs to tell us, that we are not to eſtimate the verity of a conditional, from the verity of the Antecedent, if the Antecedent neither can be ſaid to be true nor falſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if there may be affirmation and negation in the Antecedent, then may the Antecedent be either true or falſe; but there may be affirmation or negation in the Antecedent, <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> I prove from the common rule given for the right making of thoſe conditional Syllogiſms, in which the <hi>major</hi> only is Hypothetical; the Rule is, <hi>That we muſt either proceed from the poſition of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, to the poſition of the Conſequent; or from the deſtruction of the Conſequent to the deſtruction of the Antecedent;</hi> if we proceed not thus, we may from true premiſes infer a falſe concluſion: Now what is it to put <hi>ponere</hi> the Antecedent? Why, it is to bring it into the <hi>minor,</hi> with the ſame quality it had in the <hi>major;</hi> That is, if it were affirmative in the <hi>major,</hi> it muſt be affirmative in the <hi>minor;</hi> if negative in the <hi>major,</hi> then nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the <hi>minor:</hi> Ay, but whatever dull Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans prate, is not the Antecedent in every Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical, conditional, imperfect? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is not; for the <hi>[if]</hi> which is commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to the Antecedent, is no part of the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105061:11"/>but it is the <hi>copula</hi> that converteth the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent and the Conſequent, juſt as the Verb <hi>[is]</hi> in a Categorical, coupleth the ſubject and predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. Let this be the example, <hi>if the Sun ſhineth, it is day;</hi> here be two propoſitions, <hi>the Sun ſhineth, it is day,</hi> both are joined into one compound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition by the Conjunction <hi>if;</hi> and the plain mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, if the firſt propoſition be true, the ſecond is alſo. No leſs ignorance doth the Dr. bewray, when he ſaith, <hi>In every hypothetical Syllogiſm, the major propoſition conſiſteth of two parts, or branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, whereof one is called the Antecedent, the other the conſequent:</hi> For I can make him an Hundred Hypothetical Syllogiſms, in which the <hi>minor</hi> only and concluſion ſhall be Hypothetical, and the <hi>major</hi> a plain Categorical. It may be Mr. <hi>D.</hi> will ſay, this ſhakes not his Corn; and indeed it doth not: but he alſo might have done well, before he dabled in the Printers Ink, to read over ſome Compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums; then would he have amended the Title of above Fifty Pages in his Book, not writing <hi>The Conformity of the Reformed Churches, with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church of England;</hi> for this Enunciation, <hi>There is a conformity betwixt the Reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and the Reformed Church of England in the things of preſent controverſie,</hi> cannot be proved, but by an Induction, ſhewing, that all, or the moſt, or the moſt famous Reformed Churches, agree with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in all, or moſt, or the chiefeſt of thoſe matters the preſent Nonconform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts ſcruple. Hath he ſhewed this? he doth as good as confeſs he hath not; for Page 53. Sect. 63. giving us the <hi>ſumma totalis</hi> of his atchievements,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105061:11"/>he plainly ſays, it amounts but to thus much, <hi>There is hardly one of the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of England that is not uſed in ſome one Reformed Church or other.</hi> Which ſuppoſe he had proved (as he hath not) he is, many ſtages off from the concluſion he propounded to infer; if he deem he is not, let him write a Book to prove that the Language of the <hi>Matachuſes</hi> is conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language, becauſe there is ſome one word in which both languages do agree, and ſee whether he will not be laughed at to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>But I will free my mind from all prejudices that may be taken againſt Mr. <hi>D.</hi> on the account of his Country; nor will I create him any odium from the high <hi>elogiums</hi> he beſtows on the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> ſentenced by King and Parliament to perpetual baniſhment, as unworthy to live in <hi>England,</hi> (though I wonder Mr. <hi>D.</hi> doth no where bewail his ſin or miſery in heaping ſo many praiſes on him who deſerved ſo few) 'Tis not the man, but his Book I am to undertake, and in it I will ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Where there is a real controverſy betwixt <hi>Epiſcoparians</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> he quite miſtakes it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he takes a great deal of pains to prove that which was never queſtioned by any ſober man among us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he defiles his Paper with many untruths and falſhoods.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That he hath let fall not a few paſſages which are manifeſtly prejudicial and deſtructive
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105061:12"/>to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is now eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
            <p>As to the real controverſies now on foot, the principal of them may be reduced to three general Heads, <hi>Epiſcopacy, Liturgy, Ceremonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ſay, that if they conform, <hi>they muſt receive Epiſcopacy as an order by Divine Law, ſuperior to Presbytery, and inveſted with ſole power of order and juriſdiction:</hi> Search Mr. <hi>Durell</hi>'s Book with Candles, and if there be in it any one Line tending to prove that either there is any ſuch Epiſcopacy in any one reformed Church, or that any one Reformed Church, if her judgment were asked, would approve ſuch an Epiſcopacy, and I will confeſs my ſelf miſtaken. He reckoneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf moſt ſecure of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, and among the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> eſpecially of ſuch as are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a Monarchy, particularly he tells us, That in <hi>Denmark they have Biſhops, and Arch bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, name and thing,</hi> Page 5. How much he is miſtaken in this, will ſoon appear, if we conſult the Hiſtory of the Reformation of that Kingdom. About the year 1537, <hi>Bugenbagius</hi> is ſent for into <hi>Denmark,</hi> where the Twelfth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed all the Eccleſiaſtical part of the Kings Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation; and Fourteen days after that Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ordained Seven Superintendents, to be keepers and executors of all Eccleſiaſtical Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to do the office of Biſhops: Now I ask, ſeeing <hi>Bugenhage</hi> was but a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> whether he put the Superintendents into an order higher than his own? if he did, who gave him an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſo to do? If he did not, then are there no
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105061:12"/>Biſhops properly ſo called in <hi>Denmark. Melchior Adam,</hi> who relates this of <hi>Bugenhagius,</hi> relates alſo in the life of <hi>Luther,</hi> that he, calling Three other <hi>Presbyters</hi> to join with him in laying on of hands, ordained <hi>Nicholas Amdſorf</hi> Biſhop, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diating one choſen by the Colledg of Canons, and very dear to the Emperor; That is, he ordained one by the name of a Biſhop, but he was only a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and could not think himſelf to be of an higher Order, being ordained by <hi>Luther</hi> that was but a meer <hi>Presbyter.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Gerhard</hi> acquaints us, That the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or at leaſt ſome of them, did proclaim the Ordinations in their Churches to be void and null, becauſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by <hi>Luther</hi> who was no Biſhop; but that ever any <hi>Lutheran</hi> thought their Ordinations leſs valid on that account, will never be proved. I have read <hi>Hunnius</hi> his Demonſtration of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Miniſtry; and though he were himſelf a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent, yet he ſo little magnifies his Office, that he ſticks not to affirm, <hi>That he who ordains, ordains only as the Officer of the Church; and that any one whatever that ſhould by the Church be ſet to ordain, would ordain as validly as a Biſhop doth.</hi> And, if it will do Mr. <hi>D.</hi> any kindneſs, I can, and will on his deſire, direct him to a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> who calls us <hi>Anglos Papizantes,</hi> for ſtraining Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy ſo high, and appropriating Ordination to that Order: <hi>Chemnitius</hi> had occaſion to examine the Anathematizing Decrees of the Conventicle of <hi>Trent;</hi> one of them was, <hi>If any one ſhall ſay that a Biſhop is not ſuperior to a Presbyter, let him be Anathema.</hi> There he was neceſſitated to ſhew the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105061:13"/>judgment of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, and yet he there delivereth nothing, but what the Engliſh-<hi>Presbyterians</hi> can ſubſcribe to; and though the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable <hi>Philip Melancthon</hi> was blamed for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more to Biſhops than was meet; yet he hath not given more to them, than what the Engliſh Nonconformiſts are ready to give them.</p>
            <p>Thus of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches. It will not be ſo difficult for me to find out the judgment of the Churches more ſtrictly called Reformed, becauſe I ſhall find the moſt famous of them except the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican,</hi> meeting together at the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi> Of the <hi>Gallican</hi> therefore by themſelves; and I ſay, that the Writers of thoſe Churches have done more againſt our Engliſh Hierarchy, than the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of any, or all Reformed Churches beſides. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some of them have made it their buſineſs to overthrow the credit of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epiſtles, from which, more than from any writing whatever, our Hierarchy doth ſtrengthen it ſelf.

Becauſe death did prevent him, therefore his friend Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Dally</hi> hath done that work for him; and it is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105061:13"/>ſaid, that Dr. <hi>Pierſon</hi> hath news ſent him, That if he think meet to reply upon <hi>Dally,</hi> he ſhall not long want a rejoinder.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe that have defended our Engliſh Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, have not been more uncivilly dealt with by any, than by learned <hi>French</hi>-men.

            </p>
            <p>Will the <hi>French</hi> Churches ſilence him that ſhould aſſert the <hi>jus Divinum</hi> of Epiſcopacy? and yet will Mr. <hi>Durell</hi> go about to perſwade us, that they do not condemn our Engliſh Hierarchy, which aſſerts it ſelf to be Divine, and cares not for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all, if it be not ſuch? The Two Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops in Dr. <hi>Bastwicks</hi> Caſe, did proteſt even in open Court, <hi>That if they could not prove their Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Juriſdiction and Function, which they claimed and exerciſed over other Ministers, and themſelves as they were Biſhops, to be ſuperior in power, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and degree to other Ministers,</hi> Jure Divino,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105061:14"/>
               <hi>they would forthwith caſt away their Rochets off their backs, lay down their Biſhopricks at his Majeſties feet, and not continue one hour longer Biſhops.</hi> If therefore Mr. <hi>D.</hi> can bring any eminent <hi>French</hi> Divines that found Epiſcopacy, as diſtinct from, and ſuperior to, <hi>Presbytery,</hi> on any Divine Law, he will do ſomething to ſtop the mouths of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts; but ſuch he will never be able to bring, unleſs he firſt cauſe the Golden Ball to run before them, or fill them with that which blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the eyes of the wiſe. Certain I am, that Dr. <hi>Andrew Rivet,</hi> in his <hi>ſumma Controver.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Tract. 22. Queſt. thus ſtates the queſtion: <hi>We diſpute not whether Biſhops be,</hi> de facto, <hi>above Presbyters; but whether they be ſo,</hi> de jure; <hi>nor is the queſtion of Humane, but Divine Law: We deny that Biſhops by Divine Law have any pre-eminence above Presbyters.</hi> This is the more conſiderable, becauſe it is dedicated to four great Proteſtant Divines, <hi>Peter Moulin, William Rivet, John Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian Langle, Samuel Bochart;</hi> and becauſe it is again repeated in <hi>Rivets</hi> Writings againſt <hi>Grotius.</hi> When ſome Miniſters were by the Aſſembly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to get foreign Divines, by ſome Letters, to ſignifie their minds in the controverſy of our <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> among others, the ſaid Miniſters went to this Dr. <hi>Rivet,</hi> then at the <hi>Hague,</hi> deſiring him, that he would be pleaſed to ſignifie his mind: He excuſed himſelf from Writing, becauſe of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to—but took down one of his Books, in which he denied the Divine Right of <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> delaring, That was his judgment, which he would never deny. This I had from the mouth of a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105061:15"/>very Reverend perſon ſtill alive, who was one em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to diſcourſe him.</p>
            <p>But I have a later teſtimony; when the <hi>Scots</hi> went to <hi>Breda</hi> to treat with their King, Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> put a Preface to <hi>Bodius</hi> his Comment on the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> commending it to the World, and I am ſure in that, the Engliſh Hierarchy is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently beaten down. I have ſaid all that for the preſent I intend to ſay about the <hi>French</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; of other Reformed Churches I may ſpeak more briefly, becauſe moſt of them met together in a Synod at <hi>Dort,</hi> to put an end to the differences about the five points: What was done in that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod? Why, ſaith Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> in his <hi>Appeal,</hi> page 70, <hi>In it, and in other</hi> Dutch <hi>Synods, the Diſcipline of the Church of</hi> England <hi>is held unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> At this Mr. <hi>Durell</hi> had need to beſtir him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for either Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> or he will be found to be a Liar: I ſhall not determine who is to blame; but by reading the Acts of that Synod, I do find, that Seſſion 144, notice was given, That it was the will of the States, that the Confeſſion of Faith of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, ſhould be read and examined by the Synod, the <hi>Exteri</hi> being alſo preſent. The One and thirtieth Article of that Confeſſion, when it comes to ſpeak particularly of the Miniſters of the Word, ſaith, <hi>That in what place ſoever they be, they have the ſame power and authority, as being all the Miniſters of Chriſt, the only <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhop, and only Head of the Church.</hi> Theſe words would not down with our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, becauſe directly oppoſite to government by Archbiſhops and Biſhops in <hi>England:</hi> Whereupon
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105061:15"/>the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Landaff,</hi> in his own name, and the name of his Brethren, <hi>made open proteſtation, That whereas in the Confeſſion there was inſerted a ſtrange conceit of the Parity of Miniſters to be inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Chriſt, he declared his own and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns utter diſſent in that point.</hi> Now hence, I thus argue, either the words in that Article do condemn our Government in <hi>England,</hi> or they do not; if they do not, why did our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Divines concern themſelves to make <hi>protestation, open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation</hi> againſt them? If they did, then all at once down falls the one half of Mr. <hi>Durell</hi>'s Book: For then the <hi>Holland</hi> Churches in their very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith condemn the Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and if the <hi>Holland</hi> Churches do ſo, other Churches do ſo alſo: For by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of no other Church beſides the Engliſh, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſlike ſhewn to thoſe words, aſſerting the parity of all Miniſters. As for the Deputies of the <hi>Gallo-Belgick</hi> Churches, they declared, That the <hi>French</hi> Churches, though not there preſent, had before, in a National Synod held in the City of <hi>Vitriack</hi> 1583, declared ſolemnly, <hi>their approbation, not only of the Doctrine, but alſo of the Diſcipline of their</hi> Holland <hi>Brethren:</hi> No wonder they ſo readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſented, for an Egg is not more like to an Egg, than is the <hi>Gallican</hi> Confeſſion to the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> in the matters of Miniſters and Diſcipline; both of them are a note above the <hi>Ela</hi> of many, who have the ill hap to be called <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and loſe their livings here in <hi>England:</hi> both ſay, <hi>That this is one part of the Polity taught in the word, that there ſhould be in the Church of Christ, Pastors,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105061:16"/>Elders, Deacons.</hi> To this it is like that Mr. <hi>Durell</hi> himſelf hath ſubſcribed; for he ſomewhere tells us, That he had for ſome years a place among the <hi>French Protestants;</hi> and he tells us, page 54, <hi>That no man is to be ordained a Miniſter, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to any other office in the ſaid hurc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, but he muſt ſubſcribe, beſides the publick Confeſſion of their Faith, the Canons and Conſtitutions agreed on at</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, <hi>commonly known by the name of their Diſcipline.</hi> Now if a man ſhould go to him, and ask him whether he believes it to be any piece of Chriſts Polity, that there ſhould be in his Church Elders, Ruling-Elders, diſtinct from Preaching Elders or Paſtors, he would either ſay <hi>no</hi> or ſay <hi>nothing.</hi> Why did he with his hand ſubſcribe to that which he did not with his heart believe? Perhaps he is a <hi>Latitudinarian,</hi> or hath a Sluce in his Conſcience. But the ſimple Nonconformiſts in <hi>England</hi> dare not ſay they aſſent to all, and every thing, if there be ſomething unto which they do not unfeignedly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; they ſay, they can promiſe not publickly to contradict any thing delivered in the Liturgy or Book of Ordination; and ſome who are beneficed and dignified, tell them, they mean no more, by profeſſing aſſent and conſent. But Nonconformiſts cannot bring themſelves to imagine, that form of words imports no more. What a miſery it is, that ſo many Families ſhould be ruined for want of a diſtinguiſhing faculty! <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a Receipt, which if they can but take, may cure them of their ſcrupuloſity; (but let them fear leſt it purge them of their Conſcience alſo:) For thus he, <hi>What if the Magiſtrate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105061:16"/>words and forms of ſpeaking, by which an opinion directly contrary to our faith and opinion is wont to be expreſſed?</hi> Anſw. <hi>As long as my opinion is not known, if thoſe forms be ſuch, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſuch words which admit a true ſenſe, though a falſe be wont to be expreſſed by them, I allow them for peace ſake.

            <p>My Lord of <hi>Landaff</hi>'s <hi>Proteſtation</hi> hath ſet my Pen a running further and faſter than I deſigned; yet I will not give it check, until I have alſo taken notice of ſomething elſe, which his Lordſhip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in his Book againſt <hi>Mountague,</hi> viz. <hi>That he told ſome Divines of the Synod, the cauſe of all their troubles was, becauſe they had no Biſhops amongſt them, who by their authority might repreſs turbulent ſpirits, that broached novelty, every man having liberty to ſpeak or write what they iſt.</hi> It ſeems his Lordſhip was of opinion, thas if <hi>Holland</hi> had but been bleſſed with Biſhops, <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> had never come to ſuch an Head in the Low-Countries; and ſo the <hi>Papiſts</hi> tell us, That if we would but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> we ſhould then have no differences about the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet never any Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſet out any infallible Commentary upon the Bible; nor hath any Epiſcopal authority in <hi>England</hi> proved ſufficient to root up <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> among us. Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> when he firſt ſowed the ſeeds thereof, was of Biſhop <hi>Carleton</hi>'s own Dioceſs, why did he not prevent his innovations taking root? Why could he not keep his own Book againſt them, from being ſuppreſſed? What was the matter that no Convocation ever decided ſo important a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy?</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:105061:17"/>
            <p>I find indeed His Majeſty (<hi>Mountague</hi> having been much vexed by the Commons) about the year 1626, commanding all the Biſhops to come before him, reprehending ſuch as appeared, for not making known to him what was meet to be done about the Five points that made ſuch a noiſe: but Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> laying their heads together, thought it was not ſafe to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the determining of thoſe points to a Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till they could get a Convocation more of their own minds; wherefore after all expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nothing came forth, but a Proclamation from His Majeſty, <hi>Charging his Divines not to vent their heats, by raiſing any doubts, or publiſhing and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any new inventions or opinions concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> Much like to an Order, the Remonſtrants by means of <hi>Barnevelt</hi> procured from the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> on purpoſe to prevent the calling of a Synod. Of late indeed, I find <hi>Arnold Poelen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> in a Preface to the <hi>2d</hi> Volume of <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> his Works, boaſting of the great favour that the Remonſtrant opinions and Authors, find with our Prelates, and with the leading men in both Univerſities; but perhaps he <hi>reckons,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is, <hi>without his hoſt.</hi> All experience tells us, that <hi>Epiſcopacy without the Aſſiſtance of the Civil Magiſtrate, will not put an end to our ſtrifes and contentions; and with the aſſiſtance of the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate Presbytery may do it.</hi> But I return to Mr. <hi>D.</hi> whom I oppoſed with an Argument drawn from the Synod of <hi>Dort;</hi> I muſt not forget that he alſo takes notice of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and from the civil and reſpectful language given in it by <hi>Bogerman</hi> to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105061:17"/>the Biſhop of <hi>Landaff,</hi> concludes, That <hi>Holland condemns not our Hierarchy.</hi> And look how many Tranſmarine Divines he finds dedicating Books to our Biſhops or Archbiſhops, and giving them the titles by which they are commonly called among us; ſo many good mediums he conceives he hath found to prove that beyond the ſeas the office of a Biſhop or Archbiſhop is liked and honoured. I only deſire him, if he can, to be as good natured to our Engliſh-men, and to believe <hi>Thomas Cartwright</hi> was a Convert, becauſe writing to the Archbiſhop he gives him his Titles; and that Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> had no deſign to <hi>unbiſhop Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates his book <hi>to the right reverend Fathers in God,</hi> William <hi>of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>and</hi> Richard of York, <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of all</hi> England, <hi>and Metropolitans.</hi> And if his heart do not fail him, let him alſo infer, That <hi>Francis Maſon</hi> had no diſlike of Popiſh Hierarchy, becauſe in a Dedicatory to <hi>Henry</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> he calls him <hi>Ampliſſimum Praeſulem,</hi> and <hi>Antiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Clariſſimum,</hi> and <hi>Virum Reverendiſſimum.</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> was not Maſter of ſo much charitable Logick; for ſpeaking (<hi>Hiſt.</hi> of <hi>Preſ.</hi> p. 282.) of Biſhop <hi>Grindals</hi> holding correſpondence with <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza, Zanchy, Bullinger, Gualter,</hi> and ſome other of the chief Divines among the <hi>Switzers,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes at length, <hi>That they all had their ends upon him, for the advancing of Presbytery and Inconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the Church of England.</hi> And really I have obſerved, that moſt of the Divines that have by their Letters ſtroaked our Biſhops, have in ſome places of their Writings given a ſhrewd knock to the Cauſe defended by them. Mr. <hi>Durell,</hi> p. 281. tells us,

            <p>Certainly this is not as much as can be wiſhed to teſtifie <hi>Danaeus</hi> his good liking of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as it is by Law eſtabliſhed. <hi>Friderick Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem</hi> is another whoſe complaiſant Dedicatory to the great <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> ſeems to Mr. <hi>D.</hi> a ſufficient argument to prove that the Reformed Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> is no enemy to the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and yet <hi>Spanhem</hi> in that very third part of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Doubts, which he dedicates to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, determines <hi>it lawful for the innocent perſon after divorce to marry another wife;</hi> quite contrary to Eccleſiaſtical Laws ſtill unrepealed in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Well, that is but a Peccadillo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many of our own Conformable Divines are of the ſame mind, and as I ſuppoſe, ſome of our Biſhops alſo. Dr. <hi>Abbot</hi> anſwering <hi>Biſhops</hi> Second part, p. 315. ſaith, <q>That the limitation of divorce which our Saviour giveth, maketh it lawful for the party innocent to marry again, the delinquent being left to the cenſure of the Church, until ſatisfaction be given of true repentance for ſo hainous a ſin. The Church of <hi>England</hi> notwithſtanding, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of ſome miſchieſs that by the wickedneſs of men do ariſe by the abuſe of the liberty of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage upon divorce, uſeth a reſtraint of that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105061:19"/>that the parties divorced ſhall put in caution not to marry again as long as they both live.</q> As for the Authors of the reformation of our Eccleſiaſtical laws <hi>de Adult. &amp; divort.</hi> c. 6. they determine plainly, <hi>Cum alter conjux adulterii damnatus eſt, alteri licebit inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centi novum ad matrimonium (ſi volet) progredi:</hi> and <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>Judex quoties alterum conjugem adulterii condemnat, alteri ſincerae perſonae libertatem denunciare debet ad novum matrimonium tranſeundi.</hi> And <hi>cap.</hi> 19. <hi>Menſae ſocietas &amp; thori ſolebat in certis criminibus adimi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugibus, ſalvo tamen inter illos reliquo matrimonii jure; quae conſtitutio cum à ſacris literis aliena ſit, &amp; maximam perverſitatem habeat, &amp; malorum ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinam in matrimonium comportaverit, illud authoritate noſtra totum aboleri placet.</hi> But this, it ſeems, is not current doctrine now, and ſo let it paſs. The afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Friderick Spanhem</hi> makes Ruling-Elders to be one of thoſe orders of Officers that are deſigned by Chriſt for the ruling of his Church, and affirms them to be grounded on Scripture, 1 Cor. 12.8. 1 Tim. 5.17. So I find him quoted by <hi>Hornbeck</hi> Inſtitut. <hi>Theol.</hi> p. 523, 524. And it will be difficult for Mr. <hi>Durell</hi> to prove that he can approve the divine right of Epiſcopacy, who makes Lay-Elders (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſo called) a divine inſtitution.</p>
            <p>Leaving Epiſcopacy, let us come to Liturgy, that we may ſee whether Mr. <hi>Durell</hi> be any more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in managing that Controverſie. I do eaſily grant, that he hath by a whole cloud of witneſſes proved,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſet-forms of prayer are lawful.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That moſt Churches reformed do uſe ſet-forms of prayer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the old Engliſh Common prayer-book
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105061:19"/>was not ſo corrupt, as that a man could not without defiling his conſcience, joyn with thoſe who made uſe of it in the ſervice of God. But all theſe things had been proved many years before, by an old Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt (who died about the beginning of the late Wars) Mr. <hi>John Ball,</hi> both in his tryal of the grounds tending to ſeparation, and in his anſwer to Mr. <hi>Cann</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Durell</hi> will do any thing to purpoſe in this Controverſie relating to Liturgies, he muſt prove,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is lawful for any Church ſo ſtrictly to tye up her Miniſters to a form, as not to allow them to make any uſe of their own gifts in prayer in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
            <p>Or elſe, <hi>2dly,</hi> That our Church hath not ſo tied up her Miniſters, but that they may ſtill, any Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick or Canon to the contrary notwithſtanding, uſe their own prayer at ſome times, and upon ſome occaſions in the publick.</p>
            <p>If he will endeavour to prove the firſt, the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> will be concerned to anſwer him. If the ſecond, there are many of his Conforming bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren will ſoon be upon his bones; but for ought I ſee or can find, Mr. <hi>D.</hi> never goes about either to prove the one or the other propoſition; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I might be excuſed if I did wholly diſmiſs him, and leave him to ſome of his friends to reconcile him to his own ſhadow; yet becauſe he ſwaggers, and accounts that he hath by one thruſt left the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Divines, and the two Houſes of Parliament weltring in their blood, I will try <hi>quid tanto dignum feret hic promiſſor hiatu.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:105061:20"/>
            <p>The things laid to the charge of the two Houſes, and the Aſſembly choſen by them, are <hi>manifeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, and thoſe uttered in an Ordinance, and in a preface to a Directory for the publick Worſhip of God throughout the three kingdoms,</hi> vid. p. 3. If any manifeſt untruths are delivered by them, let them (for me) lye down in their own ſorrow and ſhame, till they have made reparation to the parties injured. But firſt, we muſt ſee whether this heavy charge can be made good againſt them, elſe the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance muſt be laid on him that brought in the charge. The firſt untruth is, <hi>That the book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer had proved an offence to the Reformed Churches abroad.</hi> Is this an untruth, and a manifeſt untruth too? Why, are not the <hi>Walachian</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in <hi>Zealand,</hi> Reſormed Churches? and was not the Liturgy uſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to them? Let Mr. <hi>D.</hi> read what <hi>Apollonius</hi> in the name of the whole Claſſis hath written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and then tell us his mind; let him alſo read the ſeveral Letters written by <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> touching our Liturgy, and it will be very evident, that ſome things in our Engliſh Liturgy were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive at <hi>Geneva;</hi> and a man would think ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it was offenſive to the Proteſtant Churches in <hi>France,</hi> or elſe certainly they would have uſed their intereſt with the <hi>French</hi> Churches here in <hi>England</hi> to receive it from Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured with all his might for many years to impoſe it on them, but could not prevail at laſt. Laſtly, for ought I know the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Churches may properly enough be called Churches abroad, and Mr <hi>D.</hi> will not ſure deny but that our Liturgy was offenſive to them.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:105061:20"/>
            <p>The ſecond manifeſt untruth is, that <hi>the two hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes did take away the book of Common-prayer to anſwer the expectation of other Reformed Churches.</hi> If there were other Reformed Churches beſides thoſe, for which the Directory was appointed, that expected the two Houſes ſhould take away the Common-prayer-book uſed in <hi>England,</hi> then was there no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt untruth in the before-mentioned expreſſion: Let us ſee whether there were not. The aboliſhing of the Common-prayer-book was forth Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales.</hi> Can Mr. <hi>D.</hi> imagine that no other Churches reformed, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the taking away of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgy? What thinks he of the Reformed Churches of <hi>Scotland?</hi> The Churches of <hi>New England?</hi> thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Churches that were planted up and down the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> and other places of Traffick? Will he nullifie all theſe Churches? or had they not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires as well as expectations that the Liturgy ſhould be removed? Did he never read with how great regret that Liturgy was obtruded upon thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> that trafficked in foreign Nations? If he have not, let him vouchſafe to read over the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> written by Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> and then tell us whether he was not too raſh to give ſo many Nobles, Gentlemen, and Divines the lye. If that Hiſtory bring him under no ſenſe of his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity, then I entreat him to enquire of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly-men ſtill alive, whether they cannot help him to a ſight of the Anſwers of Foreign Churches, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Latin Letter of the Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines; and by moſt of them he will find, that the deſigned Reformation was not diſguſted by them.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105061:21"/>Till he have ſuch an opportunity, it will be wort his while to beſtow a little time in reading <hi>Apo lonius</hi> his printed Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>D.</hi> again falls upon the two Houſes, p. 14. thither I will follow him; where conceiving wrath and fiery indignation againſt an expreſſion in the Ordinance of the two Houſes, he makes a Manifeſto, <hi>That there was never, nor is yet any one Reformed Church, that hath only a Directory, and not a book of Common-prayer for the publick worſhip of God.</hi> To which Manifeſto I ſay, That the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> had, when the two Houſes made that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, no Book of Common-prayer for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip of God, but what was in the nature of a Directory; and that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was principally in their eye in the management of their Reformation; and I alſo ſay, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy is but in the nature of a Directory, for ſo I underſtand thoſe words, cap. 11. art. 11. in the Harmony of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Synods, <hi>Miniſter preces vel dictante ſpiritu, vel certa ſibi propoſita formula concipiet.</hi> It may be Mr. <hi>D.</hi> will put another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction on them, for he ſeems to have uſed other Dictionaries than thoſe we have opportunity to conſult in <hi>England.</hi> In one of the <hi>French</hi> Rubricks it is ſaid, that <hi>upon Sundays in the morning the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing form is commonly uſed;</hi> he tells us, p 17. the meaning is, <hi>That that form is to be uſed always, and no other.</hi> Could any <hi>Presbyterian</hi> have thought of ſuch a meaning? or how can any one of them be convinced that <hi>commonly</hi> and <hi>always</hi> are all one? why, <hi>he may be convinced by conſtant and uniform practice,</hi> ſo he tells us, <hi>ibid.</hi> But I ſay, conſtant
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105061:21"/>and uniform practice will never make <hi>commonly,</hi> to be <hi>always.</hi> I have been a member of the Church of <hi>England</hi> for theſe Thirty years, and my occaſions have called me to be in moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Nation, and in all theſe years I never heard any Miniſter, whether Prelatical or <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> read King <hi>James</hi> his Statute againſt Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet the words of the Law are plain, That it ſhall be read twice every year, <hi>were I not a wiſe man if I ſhould ſay, the meaning of the Law is, that the Statute ſhall never be read, as conſtant and uniform practice doth ſhew?</hi> Thus have I examined what Mr. <hi>D.</hi> had to ſay againſt the Two Houſes, and the Aſſembly, and muſt now try <hi>not the words,</hi> but <hi>the power of</hi> Ludovicus Capellus a man of great Learning; but which in his later days eſpecially, he made uſe of, to the diſturbance of the Church: better had it been for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world, that <hi>Saumur</hi> had never had a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of <hi>Hebrew,</hi> than a Profeſſor that took ſo much pains to make the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Points, or Vowels, and Accents, a late invention of the <hi>Tiberian Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi> long after ſundry Tranſlations were extant in the World. All his <hi>Theſes</hi> will not do ſo much good, as his <hi>Arcanum punctationis revelatum,</hi> and <hi>Critica Sacra</hi> have done hurt. Let us notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hear what he hath concerning Liturgies, Mr. <hi>D.</hi> himſelf being Tranſlator.</p>
            <p>
               <q>A Hundred and fourty years ago, when the ſeparation was made from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the Chriſtian people, coming out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> did caſt off the Popes tyranny, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Liturgy was purged of all that Popiſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105061:22"/>and idolatry, and all ſuch things as were over-burdenſom, or which did little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contribute towards the edification of the Church; and ſo were framed and preſcribed in ſeveral places, divers ſet forms of holy Liturgies by the ſeveral Authors of the Reformation that then was, and thoſe ſimple and pure in <hi>Germany, France, England, Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Netherlands, &amp;c.</hi> differing as little as poſſible from the ancient ſet forms of the Primitive Church: which ſet forms the Reformed have uſed hitherto with happineſs and profit, each of them in their ſeveral Nations and Diſtricts: Till at laſt of very late, there did ariſe in <hi>England,</hi> a froward, ſcrupulous and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice (that I ſay not altogether ſuperſtitious) generation of men, unto whom it hath ſeemed good for many Reaſons, but thoſe very light, and almoſt of no moment at all, not only to blame, but to caſhier, and to aboliſh wholly the Liturgy uſed hitherto in their Church, (together with the whole Hierarchical Government of their Biſhops) inſtead of which Liturgy they have brought in their Directory as they call it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>D.</hi> tells us, pag. 15. That from hence the Reader may obſerve five things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That all reformed Churches have Liturgies;</hi> but I ſay, That from no words of <hi>Capellus,</hi> any ſuch obſervation can be collected; if Mr. <hi>D.</hi> think otherwiſe, his Logick is his own, let him make uſe of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Liturgy of the Church of</hi> England <hi>is judged by this great man, not only ſimple, and pure, and free from all Popiſh Superſtition and Idolatry;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105061:22"/>but alſo from all ſuch things as were over onerous and troubleſom, or which did contribute but little to the edification of the Church.</hi> No ſuch obſervation can be made from <hi>Capellus</hi> his words, for he only ſpeaks of the Liturgies that were introduced by the firſt Authors of our Reformation, betwixt which and the preſent Liturgy there may be, for ought Mr. <hi>Capell</hi> ſaith to the Contrary, a vaſt difference: But I believe this great man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended he knew not what, and talked at an high rate of confidence concerning Liturgies of the firſt Reformers which he never ſaw. A Papiſt will not deſire greater advantage againſt the <hi>Praeſes</hi> in <hi>Saumur,</hi> than to have it granted, that in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies made by the Authors of Reformation in all the places <hi>Capell</hi> mentioneth, <hi>nothing was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained onerous, or of little edification.</hi> The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th were Authors of a Reformation, their Liturgy had ſomething in it ſuperſtitious, idolatrous, leſs profitable. So had alſo the firſt Liturgy made by our Divines in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, elſe we muſt count it profitable to pray for the dead, and to commend our Prayers to be preſented by the holy Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if we ſpeak even of the preſent <hi>Lutherans</hi> Liturgies, every thing that hath little or nothing of profit in it, is not taken away; for what is the profit of <hi>Latin</hi> Cantions? or where is the advantage of Exorciſme? What good is to be got by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Conſubſtantiation? I might urge other queſtions which no friend of <hi>Capellus</hi> would much care for anſwering.</p>
            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:105061:23"/>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>If Liturgies ought to recede as little as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from that of the Primitive Church, as he doth intimate, undoubtedly the Liturgy of the Church of</hi> England <hi>is the best, and moſt perfect of them all as coming neareſt unto it.</hi> How the Reader ſhould be able to obſerve this from any words of <hi>Capel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> cannot I divine; it may be Mr. <hi>D.</hi> heartily thinks that our Liturgy cometh neareſt to the Primitive Liturgies, and ſo is the moſt perfect, becauſe <hi>primum in unoquo<expan>

            <p n="4">4. <hi>That of all men who call themſelves Reformed, the Presbyterians are the firſt that ever left the uſe of ſet forms of Prayers. Capellus</hi> uſeth not the word <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and if he had uſed it, it would have been a very blind. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſeems by <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> to mean the <hi>major</hi> part of thoſe Divines, who by vertue of an Ordinance of Parliament did meet to give advice, concerning Doctrine, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, Worſhip: If <hi>Capellus</hi> ſay, that theſe were the firſt that left off the uſe of ſet forms of Prayer,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105061:23"/>he was much miſtaken; ſet forms of Prayer had been long before laid aſide and condemned as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, by ſuch as were as little in love with <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> as Hierarchy; he may know whom I mean, if he will enquire who they were that left old <hi>England.</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> hath written the Hiſtory of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> under which name, he ſeems to bring all thoſe Proteſtants who are not <hi>Lutherans,</hi> nor ſatisfied with the Reformation of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> This Hiſtory his Son hath dedicated to the Two Houſes of Parliament now ſitting. In the <hi>2d</hi> Page of that Book it is ſaid, <q>The <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Reformation was begun in defacing Images, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crying the eſtabliſhed Faſts and appointed Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, aboliſhing ſet forms of worſhip, denying the old Catholick Doctrine of a Real Preſence, and conſequently all external reverence in the participation of the bleſſed Sacrament; which <hi>Luther</hi> ſeriouſly laboured to preſerve in the ſame eſtate in which he found them at the preſent.</q> And page 89. ſpeaking of the <hi>Palatine</hi> Churches, he would have us take them for <hi>Antilutherans</hi> in defacing Images, aboliſhing all diſtinction of Faſts and Feſtivals, and utterly denying all ſet forms of publick Worſhip. I know a great deal of this is falſe, maliciouſly falſe, as is almoſt every thing in that Book which relates to the foreign Churches; and therefore I hope the Biſhops, or others that have Authority, will either call in the Book, or ſome other way diſcover how much they abhor the deſign of it; in the mean time, here is work for Mr. <hi>Durell</hi>'s Pen, if he will not be partial, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect perſons; if he have any zeal left for <hi>Zuing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105061:24"/>Calvin, Beza,</hi> let him wipe off the aſperſion of Rebellion, Schiſm, <hi>Aerianiſm</hi> from their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or elſe let him know, that ſeeing Dr. <hi>Heylins</hi> Book came out laſt, his will be thought ſufficiently confuted.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> tells us, <hi>we may obſerve that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons for which the Presbyterians have rejected the Book of Common Prayer, are very light, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of no moment at all. Capell</hi> ſaith not ſo, but that the Reaſons for which it ſeemed to ſome ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous men, that the Liturgy uſed by their Church was not only to be diſapproved, but alſo to be plainly abrogated, and wholly to be aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and obliterated, were light and almoſt of no moment; ſo that if any man do only, <hi>improbare,</hi> having no deſign plainly to abrogate and wholly to obliterate the Liturgy compoſed by our firſt Reformers, he may have Reaſons good enough, for ought <hi>Capell</hi> affirms to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>That as for the Presbyterians</hi> (<hi>who are the known Authors of the</hi> Directory) <hi>they are in</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell<hi>'s judgment a froward, peeviſh and ſuperstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous generation of men. Capell</hi> was indeed a man who was free enough in his cenſures, of any one whether <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> that ſtood in his way, not ſearing to throw dirt in the face of the great <hi>Hooker</hi> himſelf, as appears in his Theſes about Feaſts or Holy days: But I would fain underſtand how the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are the known Authors of the <hi>Directory;</hi> moſt of thoſe who were called to give advice about the <hi>Directory,</hi> were when called to give their advice. Readers of the Liturgy, and had ſubſcribed to the Three Articles in the

            <p>And now I will try whether I can make ſome truer obſervations upon <hi>Capellus</hi> his Theſes about Liturgies; in doing which I ſhall follow the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Saumur,</hi> 1651.</p>

That Liturgies firſt began to be made in the more famous Metropolitan and Patriarchal Churches, and that in the Countries called by the name of <hi>Gallia,</hi> there were ſeveral Liturgies in almoſt every ſeveral famous Biſhoprick, and that every ſeveral did contain ſomething proper and ſingular, and different from the reſt, until
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105061:25"/>at laſt by the tyranny of the Pope, the <hi>Roman</hi> Liturgy obtained through all the Weſt.</p>
            </q>
            <p>So that it ſeems, with him, Liturgies are no older than Metropolitan and Patriarchal Churches; how old ſuch Churches were in his judgment, and upon what occaſion firſt erected, is at large declared in his Theſes, 337, 338, 339, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> little as I ſuppoſe to the guſt of Mr. <hi>D.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. He doth, <hi>Page</hi> 707, plainly miſtake the meaning of the <hi>Directory,</hi> and the Compoſers of it, when he ſuggeſts that by it, <hi>'tis left free to Miniſters to pray and adminiſter the Sacraments in what words they pleaſe;</hi> for the <hi>Directory</hi> tieth Miniſters to a certain form in the adminiſtration of Baptiſm and the Lords-Supper, as alſo in the ſolemnization of Marriage. Throughout the whole <hi>Directory</hi> there are, though not Prayers preſcribed to be uſed <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> without any variation, yet ſuch Heads of Prayer, as that he who needs greater help and furniture to enable him for Confeſſion, Petition, Thankſgiving, may well be thought unfit for the Office of a Paſtor. And I obſerve, <hi>That the</hi> Directory <hi>orders Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in Prayer before Sermon, to commend to Gods bleſſing the Parliament if ſitting, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and all Schools, and Religious Seminaries of Church and Common-wealth,</hi> but in no Liturgy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this laſt, was there any Prayer for the High Court of Parliament; nor in this laſt is there any Prayer for the Univerſities or Schools of Learning; yet in the Conſtitutions of 1603, <hi>In all Colledges and Halls in both <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, order, form, cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are to be obſerved, as they are ſet down,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105061:25"/>and preſcribed in the Book of Common Prayer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any omiſſion or alteration.</hi> Is not this in effect to tie the Univerſities never publickly to pray for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? If any one ſhould preſcribe a Family a form of Prayer, in which was no mention of a Family, it would be thought a ſtrange form.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Capell,</hi> page 708. tells us, <hi>That ſacred Sermons to the people, and exhortations, ſhould be made and compoſed by the Paſtors themſelves, and recited to the people either by heart, or out of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, if they can do no other. Poſtills and Homilies as much as may be are to be driven out of the Church; yet it is better,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that men ſhould hear one reading anothers Sermons, than hear none at all.</hi> In this the Nonconformiſts throughly agree with him, but ſome of them will not ſtick to ſay, that if ſome in authority had been as zealous for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons as they might have been, we needed not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time, have wanted for any Cure, a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter able to make a Sermon of his own: And whereas <hi>Capel</hi> ſaith, That Homilies ſhould not be read, leſt they prove, <hi>pulvinar ignaviae &amp; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiae, &amp; fomes ignorantiae,</hi> they are wont to urge the ſame Argument againſt ſet forms of Prayer; he might have done well to ſhew that the Reaſon is not alike forcible in both.</p>
            <p>He ſaith, <hi>ibid. Thoſe he had to deal with, deny not but that Leſſons, Pſalms and Hymns may be read out of a Book to the people, recited and ſung; only Hymns and Songs compoſed by others than men divinely inſpired,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>they allow not to have any uſe in the publick Congregation.</hi> Therefore, ſay I, he did not intend to deal with the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:105061:26"/>who will never be found any where to have ſaid, that no Hymns may lawfully be ſung, but ſuch as are compoſed by men divinely inſpired; I my ſelf have heard ſome of them ſing others, without blame from any of their brethren, nor is there any one tittle in the Directory to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Let me here enquire whether the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church hath taken any care to have any <hi>Pſalms</hi> ſung in the Congregation; tranſlation of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> into meter we have none generally known, but only that compoſed by <hi>Hopkins, Sternhold, &amp;c.</hi> 'Tis ſaid that Tranſlation is allowed (allowed, not enjoyned) to be uſed in the Congregation; but Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> again and again, denieth that ever there was any allowance of it given by any lawful authority; ſo that the whole ſervice of God with us may be performed, it ſeems, without any ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all; for though the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> Book hath ſundry parts in it which may be ſung, yet it hath nothing that is appointed to be ſung, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, either ſung or read. I believe in this we are a ſingular Church, there being no other that I ever heard, or read of, that hath not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned her Congregations to ſing ſome <hi>Pſalms.</hi> Mr. <hi>D</hi> certainly can either prove that our Church hath allowed, and enjoyned us to ſing <hi>Pſalms,</hi> or elſe he can ſhew us ſome Reformed Church, that doth not enjoyn <hi>Pſalmody.</hi> But ſuch is my weakneſs that I cannot.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Capellus</hi> asketh us, p. 709. <hi>Whether it were not better wiſely to preſcribe certain forms of Prayer, fit for the publick edification of the Church, than to permit them to the liberty of many Paſtors, unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105061:26"/>and unexerciſed, where others cannot be had?</hi> The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> will anſwer yes; but they think, in a wealthy Nation, where the King is a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, there is no neceſſity to take any into the Church for Miniſters, if they be unlearned, and unexerciſed.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Page 100. <hi>He asketh whether in all the Prayers that are to be made in the Church, Paſtors can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually vary them, or expreſs themſelves in divers Words and Phraſes concerning the ſame Argument; yea, he asketh what Prophet or Apoſtle can do this with edification?</hi> Sure he forgets himſelf, for he before told us, Apoſtles could and did do it, and I am ſure we have had ordinary Paſtors here in <hi>England</hi> that have done it, and we have ſtill hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds and thouſands that can, and would do it, might they be permitted: Nor can I underſtand how it can be difficult to any one who hath well ſtudied the Scriptures, and obſerveth the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of God, and is affected duly with his own and peoples wants and neceſſities. I in my Family find it not difficult to vary as I pleaſe.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Page 710, 711. <hi>He contends that the Creeds are to be recited in a certain form of words; but adds, thoſe whom he dealt with did bewray a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest hatred against certain forms of Symbols, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and Catechiſm.</hi> Whence again I infer, that he dealt not with the <hi>Directorians,</hi> for they liked the uſe of Confeſſions and Catechiſms in ſet forms.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Page 713. <hi>He thinks the</hi> Apotomy <hi>and rigor of thoſe men worthily to be condemned, who under pretext of certain and preſcribed forms of Liturgy,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105061:27"/>do ſtudy to eliminate out of the Church all uſe of Prayers conceived by Miniſters themſelves.</hi> This will touch Mr. <hi>D</hi> s Copyhold, unleſs he can prove againſt Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> and others, that ſome Prayers, beſides thoſe preſcribed in the Liturgy, are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Miniſters in publick miniſtration.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Page 716. <hi>He determines, that it is better by much, and more convenient and ſafe, that thoſe writings only ſhould be publickly read which are truly Canonical, and divinely inſpired.</hi> What will the peremptory enjoyners of the Apocryphal Chapters ſay to this?</p>
            <p n="11">11. Page 719. Drawing up the ſum of all his conceptions, he ſaith, 1. <hi>That forms are not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and abſolutely neceſſary.</hi> 2. <hi>That they are not commonly neceſſary, but only for order and deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſake.</hi> 3. <hi>That they are plainly neceſſary, where we cannot have learned Miniſters.</hi> 4. <hi>Where there are learned and skilful Paſtors, a publick form of Liturgie is very uſeful and neceſſary to the common edification of the Church, in the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Divine worſhip.</hi> 5. <hi>The uſe of Liturgies cannot of right be condemned or diſallowed.</hi> To all theſe Propoſitions there are Hundreds of Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts can ſubſcribe, and are ready to ſubſcribe, the two laſt only being qualified with ſuch diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as I believe, were not either againſt, or beſides the mind of this Profeſſor. The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Browniſts</hi> and others which he ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth up and down, were fully propounded, and clearly anſwered by Mr. <hi>John Ball,</hi> before his The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſaw the light. Let Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> propoſitions concerning Liturgies be read and weighed, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105061:27"/>it will be found, that they come very near to theſe of <hi>Capellus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt now come to Ceremonies: The firſt I mention, is the uſe of a <hi>Surplice;</hi> concerning which, the Nonconformiſts ſay, That if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, they muſt receive it not <hi>only as ſerving to a decent order and godly diſcipline; but as apt to stir up the dull mind of man to the remembrance of his duty to God, by ſome notable and ſpecial ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, whereby he might be edified;</hi> but they have never found any ſuch aptneſs in it to ſtir up their dull minds to the remembrance of their duty, and that they dare not pretend to uſe a thing in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſuch an end, as they never expect to attain by it. I my ſelf have talked with ſome conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Miniſters, and asked them, whether they ever found their dull minds ſtirred up by the uſe of it? they have been loth to give me any anſwer, but what moved on the <hi>Latitudinarian</hi> hinge: One in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed told me, he did verily believe there was a wonderful vertue in it to excite his dull mind; but asking him further, whether it was apt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite him as a man, or as an Engliſh man, or as a Miniſter? He gave me a reply, which for Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſake, I will not here inſert; but ſuch it was, that I eaſily ſaw the Surplice had not cured him of all his dulneſs. Nor can I chuſe but wonder why they who pretend to be ſtirred up to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their duty by a Surplice, do uſe it ſo ſeldom: there are but few that uſe it conſtantly, ſome uſe it not above once a quarter, few uſe it in the Pulpit, yet I ſuppoſe their minds are apt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105061:28"/>to be as dull in the Pulpit as in the Desk; and the Church as much requires them to uſe the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice at all times of their Miniſtration, as at any time. Perhaps we muſt ſay of Surplices, as of pleaſure, <hi>commendat rarior uſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, but how doth Mr. <hi>D.</hi> diſcourſe of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices? Truly very innocently: He tells us, Page 23, 24. That in <hi>Aquitan when a Miniſter is buried, the neighbour Miniſters that be preſent muſt all have their Gowns, if Gowns can conveniently be had</hi> (that was wiſely put in). <hi>Now this changing of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel for divine ſervice</hi> (it ſeems burving of a Miniſter in <hi>France</hi> is Divine Service) <hi>is the very ſame thing for which the Church of</hi> England <hi>is by ſome men reputed Popiſh and ſuperſtitious, when ſhe will have her Miniſters to wear Surplices on the ſame occaſion.</hi> It ſhould ſeem with him the Surplice is no Symbolical Veſtment, and that he reckons all thoſe who put on their ſolemn apparel and beſt Clothes do the ſame thing that he doth, when he puts on ſignificant Garments: But he is ſo kind, that leſt this ſhould not ſatisfie, he will find out ſome of the beſt Reformed Churches, <hi>that count it no ſuperſtition for their Miniſters to wear a Surplice, and he inſtanceth in the</hi> Bohemians, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians, Lithuanians, <hi>who did put on the ſurplice as oft as they preached in the Churches of the</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtan <hi>confeſſion: But it ſeems they loſt nothing by this condeſcenſion, for the</hi> Lutherans <hi>officiated in their Churches without a Surplice.</hi> To requite him for this diſcovery, I will tell him of ſome <hi>Luther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Miniſters (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi>) that do not uſe a Surplice, no not in their own
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105061:28"/>Churches; ſo little do they find it to contribute to edification, that they forbear it, where they would not be blamed if they ſhould uſe it: So the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are out of his debt.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Ceremony controverted is kneeling at the Sacrament; about which, I may ſay, <hi>[Iliacos extra muros peccatur &amp; intra]</hi> I cannot by all that I have read, ſee any unlawfulneſs in it, and I hope the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> if they ſhould be asked by any, whether they had better forbear the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament than receive it kneeling, would well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think themſelves what anſwer to give. I find not that ever any of our authorized Liturgies did allow any other geſture; yet I have read in a Book, called <hi>Treaſure out of rubbiſh,</hi> 
               <q>That ſome Commiſſioners of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did about the beginning of Her Reign, at <hi>Coventry,</hi> and other places appoint, not kneeling, but ſtanding to be uſed at the Lords Table:</q> The Book was Printed by the Reverend Mr. <hi>Simeon Aſh</hi> ſince His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties return to his Throne; and I hear that many conforming Miniſters are ſo compaſſionate, as to deliver the conſecrated Elements to thoſe who do not kneel; how they can ſo do, <hi>non violata fide quam dederunt eccleſiae,</hi> I underſtand not, they themſelves I hope have ſatisfied their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and can give a reaſon of their practice to their Governors though I cannot. The Church in the <hi>2d</hi> Book of King <hi>Edward</hi> inſerted a <hi>Rubrick</hi> againſt Tranſubſtantiation, unhappily left out in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>1ſt,</hi> but through the goodneſs of our preſent Soveraign, now again put into the laſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105061:29"/>Edition of our Liturgy; may it never more be left out, but continue to the ſhame of thoſe who feared not to ſay, we left it out, becauſe it ſeemed too much to favour the Sacramentarians. The Church alſo appoints the Miniſter to uſe a kind of a Prayer, in delivering the Euchariſt, whilſt he uſeth that Prayer, the Communicant is to kneel meekly; but when he hath taken the Bread into his own hands, he may then ſit and eat it, or ſtand and eat it; I wiſh this could ſatisfie private Chriſtians, but there are Hundreds that cannot ſo quiet their own minds; and yet if you diſcourſe with them, they can make Syllogiſms, and they live peaceable and godly lives: Now here the Shoe pincheth the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt Miniſter, whether he can promiſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to give the Sacrament to any one who ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleth kneeling?</p>
            <p>Had Mr. <hi>D.</hi> clearly and ſolidly determined this queſtion, or had he ſtrongly proved that the Church could not without diſhonour allow more than one geſture in receiving the Sacrament, I could eaſily have forgiven him all the raillery of his book; but he thought he could get preferment at an eaſier rate, &amp; therefore contents himſelf, in a few lines (<hi>p.</hi> 46, 47.) to inſtance in a very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>w Reformed Churches that receive the Sacrament kneeling: Firſt, he inſtanceth in the Reformed Churches of <hi>Bohemia, Reformed above two hundred years ago; the remnant of it now left,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>receive it kneeling.</hi> This inſtance little ava<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>leth our Church, becauſe <hi>from the beginning it was not ſo;</hi> the Anceſtors of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> did at firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> 1494, <hi>uſe ſtanding; but being perſecuted on that account, were compelled to leave it off,</hi> as <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:105061:29"/>tells us; ſo that Mr. <hi>D.</hi> by this only proves the conformity of our Church with the Popiſh Church, in perſecuting thoſe who will not kneel at the Sacrament. Nor is he more lucky in his other inſtances of <hi>Polonia major,</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> for which he refers us to the <hi>Conſenſus Poloniae.</hi> What a Character Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> gives of the Reformation of <hi>Poland,</hi> let him that loveth railing ſee, <hi>Hiſt.</hi> of <hi>Presb.</hi> 31, 32, 33. Indeed the Conſent of <hi>Poland</hi> doth not much hit our humour here in <hi>England;</hi> for in the <hi>Cracovian</hi> Synod, 1573, <hi>all</hi> Choreae <hi>are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as diſhoneſt.</hi> A queſtion being moved, <hi>VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the rites in the uſe of the Lords Supper ought to be uniform? It was concluded, That according to the cuſtom of the Primitive Church, men ſhould be left to their Chriſtian liberty, yet with admonition to the brethren, that if any uſed ſitting, they ſhould leave that proper to the</hi> Arrian Anabaptiſts. In the <hi>Petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covian</hi> Synod, <hi>Anno</hi> 1578, it is determined, <hi>That uniformity in the rite of receiving the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſhould not be preſſed, leſt it ſhould happen that there might be occaſion to exerciſe Eccleſiaſtical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline upon any of the common people, who are not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily brought to unuſual ceremonies; whereas the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod judged it neither agreeable to the will of the Lord, nor the cuſtom of the Chriſtian Church more pure, to ſtrike Chriſtian men with the rod of Diſcipline for external rites, yet ſo as the geſture of ſitting at the Lords Table is rejected for a reaſon</hi> I ſhall more ſpeak of by and by. 'Tis the <hi>Synodus Wlodiſlavien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> congregated 1583, that Mr. D. pitcheth upon, in which Synod the matter of <hi>ſitting at the Lords Table</hi> is again debated; and there it is determined,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105061:30"/>
               <hi>that ſitting is as free as any other geſture;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought in by way of <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Engliſheth or taketh notice of; for he had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it an <hi>unmannerly</hi> and <hi>irreverent geſture;</hi> and it was no wiſdom to touch a knife that would be ſure to cut his fingers; but there alſo it was determined, <hi>That ſitting ſhould not be uſed at the Lords table in any of the Churches of</hi> Poland <hi>or</hi> Lithuania, <hi>for this ceremony is not uſed in Chriſtian Churches, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Aſſemblies, and is only proper to the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Arrians placing themſelves in a ſeat or throne equal to Chriſt. Seeing therefore ſitting crept into ſome of their Churches, eſpecially by occaſion of thoſe who denied the Lord that redeemed us; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and exhort all their aſſemblies and brethren in the Lord, that they would change ſitting into ſtanding or kneeling.</hi> Mr. <hi>D.</hi> tranſlates <hi>potiſſimum</hi> firſt; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he was the firſt that ſo tranſlated that word. Not content to make ſo bold with <hi>Priſcian,</hi> he ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to greater impudence, ſaying that what they obſerved <hi>about the firſt bringers in of ſitting into</hi> Poland, <hi>may be our obſervation alſo,</hi> if what Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> have ſaid be true, as it is very likely, <hi>That there is not a city, a town, ſcarce a village in</hi> England, <hi>but had ſome of the Miſcreant</hi> Socinians. Whether Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath any words of this import, I know not; if he have, 'tis like he referred them to the time in which he did make his book, which was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years after that ſitting was brought into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches by the two Houſes. Too many there were in the two Houſes, no doubt, that ſought their own things more than the Nations peace; but they never had among them any <hi>Socinian</hi> that ever
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105061:30"/>I did hear of, but only one <hi>Fry,</hi> who was alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled when he diſcovered his blaſphemies: Nor do I find that theſe Hereticks do abound in thoſe places of the Kingdom where I have been, but Papiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound extremely; ſo as the ſame thing that moved the <hi>Polonians</hi> to forbid ſitting, may move us to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid kneeling, and leave it proper to the wretched Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who worſhip a piece of bread inſtead of their Saviour.</p>
            <p>But this geſture of kneeling would be a little better conſidered: The Fathers of the before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Synods ſeem to ſay (not indeed in that Meeting which Mr. <hi>D.</hi> quotes, but in the Meeting of 1578.) <hi>That thoſe who fell off to</hi> Arrianiſm, <hi>were the firſt that were authors of ſitting in their Churches.</hi> If I miſtake their meaning, <hi>detur venia;</hi> but if I do not, I humbly conceive they were themſelves mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken. <hi>John Alaſco,</hi> a Noble-men of <hi>Poland,</hi> was upon <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s perſuaſion ſent for into our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, about the year 1549. and permitted to have a Church of ſtrangers, eſpecially of <hi>Dutch,</hi> whom he brought up to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament ſitting; and alſo during his abode here, put forth a book to prove the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that geſture: After many troubleſome wandrings from place to place, at laſt being invited by at leaſt forty Letters, he returned to his own Countrey, and no queſtion adminiſtred the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his flock ſitting, and taught others on whom he had influence ſo to do: Now this <hi>Alaſco</hi> never fell off to <hi>Arrianiſm;</hi> perhaps this was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why in the Meeting 1583. it is not ſaid, <hi>that the</hi> Arrians <hi>firſt brought in ſitting, but that it was chiefly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105061:31"/>brought in by them.</hi> The aforeſaid Fathers ſeem alſo to affirm, that <hi>ſitting had not been uſed by any Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Churches in Europe,</hi> at the time of their meeting; but if they ſo meant, they were greatly miſtaken; for ſitting was brought into the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> by authority, as the moſt proper and convenient geſture, 1560. and our Confeſſor Mr. <hi>Thomas Beacon,</hi> in an authorized Catechiſm 1563. ſpeaks of ſitting as a geſture uſed in certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, and which he himſelf could beſt allow, if it were received by publick authority and common conſent. Who the <hi>Arrian-Anabaptiſts</hi> were, that had cauſed ſuch a deteſtation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves among the <hi>Polonians,</hi> I cannot certainly know; but by ſuch ſtories as have come to my hands, I gueſs they were <hi>Georgius Blandrata,</hi> and <hi>Franciſcus Davidis</hi> and their Spawn, who both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the <hi>Divinity of Jeſus,</hi> and alſo <hi>his adorability. Socinus</hi> and his followers held the Principle, That Jeſus is not God, and yet denied the concluſion that naturally and lineally deſcended from it, That Jeſus is not to be worſhipped; for they had found out a diſtinction of <hi>Deus natus &amp; factus.</hi> The former would not ſtick to ſay. That Jeſus was one of their brethren and fellow-ſervants; ſo would the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for they aſcribed unto Chriſt a dignity and excellency nearly approaching unto the dignity and excellency of the Creator, but conferred on him by the ſingular bounty and good will of him who created him. Wherefore the <hi>Socinians</hi> properly ſo called, could not uſe ſitting at the Lords Table as a token of their equality with Chriſt, nor indeed do they much concern themſelves what geſture is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105061:31"/>uſed in Sacramental Communion. <hi>Volkelius</hi> ſaith, <hi>They uſe ſitting; but yet ſo, that they damn not thoſe who had rather uſe ſtanding, ſo as there be no appearance of idolatry.</hi> They would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they hate the very <hi>appearance of Idolatry,</hi> and yet they commit Idolatry: for what greater Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, than to worſhip him that by nature is not God, as they blaſphemouſly ſay Jeſus is not, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The laſt Ceremony, but about which there is the greateſt Controverſie, is the ſign of the Croſs. Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts ſay this ſign is made a Sacramental ſign, becauſe it is <hi>uſed as a token that the child ſhall not be aſhamed to profeſs Chriſt crucified,</hi> &amp;c. and alſo as a ceremony by which it is dedicated unto God. In clearing this ceremony therefore, Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſhould have taken moſt pains; but in this he is ſlighteſt of all. He gives us not an inſtance of any one Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church that hath appointed the ſign of the Croſs to be uſed either in Baptiſm or in any other Ordinance; only he tells us of Bibles printed at <hi>Geneva</hi> for the uſe of the Church, and that before them, Chriſtian Religion is repreſented in an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem as leaning upon a Croſs, and that ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed have Croſſes upon their Churches, and that ſome Miniſters in <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> to humor the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> will make a Croſs in the Air with their hand when they ſay, <hi>The Dord be with you.</hi> All this is to as much purpoſe, as if he had told us, that the Rumpers did uſe the ſign of the Croſs in the Flags of their Ships, and put it on the money which they coined, or that ſome Nonconformiſts have it in their Coat of Arms, as I am ſure they have.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:105061:32"/>
            <p>I believe there is not a Nonconformiſt in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that queſtioneth the lawfulneſs of making the ſign of a Croſs upon any thing he uſeth: And if the ſign of the Croſs were made ſo, as that it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and were viſible after it were made, then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it might have an aptitude to occaſion a good thought concerning a crucified Saviour; but what can be the benefit of a Croſs that leaves no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the forehead? I know the Baptiſmal water being applied to an infant, leaveth no ſuch mark on the fleſh as it can take notice of at years of diſcretion; but the Spirit, if he be not grieved, will bring our Baptiſm to our remembrance, and he hath ſo done to many in the hour of temptation; but how ſhall a man be ſecured, that the bleſſed Spirit will engage himſelf to bring our being croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to our remembrance? I have made obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and could never find any difference betwixt us that were croſſed, and thoſe who were not croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; Do we confeſs the Faith of a crucified Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? ſo do they; do we fight under his Banner? ſo do they; do we joyn our ſelves to Chriſts flock? ſo do they; the things that we know, they know alſo; ſo that they are under a temptation to think that the Croſs is an uſeleſs ſign.</p>
            <p>I muſt not diſſemble that Mr. <hi>D.</hi> takes on him in his Sermon, page 29 to explicate and ſhew the uſefulneſs of this ſign. <hi>As when the King having created thoſe noble Knights of his Order beſtows on them the Garter and the Blew Riband, as Badges to be known by of others, and to put them in mind of the great honour done unto them: In like manner, when an infant hath by Baptiſm been enrolled in the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105061:32"/>Militia of the King of Glory, Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; this ſign of the Croſs is made upon his forehead, to declare unto all ſuch as are preſent, and as many as ſhall thereafter know it, that he hath received it, and to himſelf when he comes to years of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that he was conſecrated to Chriſt crucified, that he hath put on his Livery, and wears his Badge, that he is bound to crucifie the old man, and to bear the Croſs, that to this he is called by our Saviour; that he ought in all places, and in the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous occurrences, boldly and openly to own the name of his Redeemer, without ever being aſhamed with bearing his reproach.</hi> As the Barrels go rumbling up and down the Streets, ſo my Lord Mayor owes me a Groat. The King, the founder of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Order, gives the Knights created by him a Garter and a Blew Riband, as Badges to be known by others, but would not be pleaſed if they ſhould among themſelves invent other badges and cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zances of their Order. Chriſt alſo hath inſtituted Baptiſm to diſtinguiſh Chriſtians from thoſe who are no Chriſtians; How do we know whether it will like him, that we ſhould appoint a Croſs to diſtinguiſh us more, eſpecially ſeeing thereby we ſhall be diſtinguiſhed from a great number of our fellow Chriſtians. Again, the Garter and Blew Riband are things to be worn, and that may be ſeen, and occaſion ſpectators to enquire what they mean, but ſo is not the Croſs that was made on our foreheads after Baptiſm; the Pagans that any of us have been among, could take no notice of it; and if our Parents did at any time admoniſh us of our engagement to crucifie the old man, they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105061:33"/>put us in mind, not of being croſſed, but of being baptized with Water, to ſignifie the not only death, but burial of the old man; nor have our Kings of <hi>England</hi> been ſo fond of all the Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies uſed at making of Knights of the Garter, but that they have allowed ſome of them to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, where they have conceived they might be leſs acceptable. King <hi>James</hi> being much pleaſed with the valour and piety of <hi>Maurice</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> ſent him a Garter, appointing his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador Sir <hi>Ralph Winwood</hi> to confer the honour on him freely, and without any Rites or Laws, but what the Prince himſelf would ſpontaneouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo. And the Embaſſador in a <hi>French</hi> Speech declared, that the Rites wonted to be uſed in creating Knights of the Garter, did ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abhorrent from the Diſcipline of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches in <hi>Holland,</hi> and not altogether congruous to the polity of the Republick; and that therefore the King to avoid offence had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it to be conferred without pomp and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal magnificence. I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>D.</hi> thinks there is no Rite uſed in the creation of the Knights of St. <hi>George,</hi> that is contrary to the Diſcipline of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches; but the King was of another mind, and choſe rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the higheſt honour without the wonted Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, than not to confer it upon one who was like not to diſgrace it. And ſhall Miniſters of the Goſpel ſo ſtifly ſtand upon Ceremonies, as rather not to adminiſter baptiſm, than to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter it without the ſign of the Croſs?</p>
            <p>I muſt follow Mr. <hi>D.</hi> who tells, us, <hi>That ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105061:33"/>reformed Churches have a Ceremony, of which,</hi> Presbyterians <hi>ought to have as bad an opinion, as of the Croſs in Baptiſm: The Ceremony he meaneth is Trine aſperſion,</hi> page 42. Why ought they to have as bad an opinion of Trine Aſperſion, as of the Croſs in Baptiſm? is there any Law either of God or man, that tieth them to have as bad an opinion of the Trine Aſperſion as of the Croſs? or do their Principles lead them to have as bad an opinion of one Ceremony as of the other? I verily believe they do not; for they ſay, that Chriſt hath commanded Baptiſm, and hath not ſtrictly determined whether it ſhall be adminiſtred by Aſperſion or Immerſion, nor whether by <hi>trine</hi> or <hi>une</hi> aſperſion or immerſion; therefore the Church hath power to chuſe the Rite, that to her, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſulted the general rules of Scripture, and practice of the Primitive Churches, ſhall ſeem beſt. But they alſo ſay, that God hath no where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that a Child ſhall be croſſed, or any where appointed his Church to inſtitute any ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical, teaching ſigns at all; if Mr. <hi>D.</hi> can ſhew them any command that a Child ſhould be croſſed, they will not ſtick to grant, that it is in the Churches power to order, where the Child ſhall be croſſed, and how often, and what kind of croſs it ſhall be: But it is to be feared he can ſhew no ſuch command, at leaſt none ſuch is ſhewed by him; and yet he ſaith, <hi>he is confident that if the</hi> trine <hi>aſperſion were uſed, or if we had retained the</hi> trine <hi>immerſion, as at the beginning of King</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>the ſixths reign, it would be accounted a groſs ſuperſtition.</hi> How may a man do to free him from
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105061:34"/>this uncharitable confidence ſo contrary to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity? I dare undertake to give it him under the hand and ſeal of as many as I am acquainted with, that if the Church ſhall think meet to uſe <hi>trine</hi> aſperſion, or <hi>trine</hi> immerſion, ſhe ſhall not be accounted either groſly, or at all ſuperſtitious, provided ſhe declare that ſhe doth not uſe either rite as neceſſary. If by <hi>trine</hi> either aſperſion or immerſion ſhe ſhould prejudice the Babes in their health, that would be a ſin, but not the ſin of ſuperſtition. But how doth Mr. <hi>D.</hi> prove, that the Church hath not retained <hi>trine</hi> immerſion? Immerſion it is plain ſhe hath enjoyned, unleſs the Sureties certifie that the Child be weak (yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Miniſter of the Church, in my hearing, demanded ſuch Certificate; never did any Parents bring their Child in a dreſs fit for dipping, that ever I could obſerve, and yet I believe that I have ſeen as ſtrong Children Baptized as are in moſt places of <hi>England</hi>) and ſhe no where ſaith it ſhall be dipped but once, as neither doth ſhe ſay, that it ſhall be ſprinkled but once; ſo that Biſhop <hi>Mountague</hi> in his Viſitation Articles poſitively aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, That the Child is to be thrice aſperſed with water on the face; it may be ſome other Prelate of that age did as poſitively aſſert that the Child was to be ſprinkled but once, for thoſe who have been moſt zealous to preſs Conformity, have been at Daggers drawing about the meaning of ſome paſſages in that Liturgy, to which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſubſcription. In the <hi>Hampton Court</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, the Metropolitan told the King, <hi>That the adminiſtration of Baptiſm by women and lay perſons
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105061:34"/>was not allowed in the practice of the Church, but enquired of by Biſhops in their viſitations and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured; neither do the words in the Liturgy infer any ſuch meaning:</hi> But the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>That thoſe learned men who framed the Book of Common-Prayer, intended not by ambiguous terms to deceive any, but did intend a permiſſion of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons to baptize in caſe of neceſſity, and withal declared that the ſame was agreeable to the practice of the ancient Church, urging both a place in the</hi> Acts, <hi>and the authority of</hi> Tertullian <hi>and St.</hi> Ambroſe <hi>plain in that point:</hi> (What could a man have done that had lived in thoſe days to know the meaning of the Church?) But however King <hi>James</hi> being clear in his own judgment, that a <hi>Miniſter is of the eſſence of the right and lawful miniſtry of the Sacrament,</hi> carried it, ſo as the words thereafter did run thus, <hi>That private Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm ſhould be performed by the Miniſter of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, or in his abſence by any other lawful Miniſter that can be procured:</hi> Now any man would think Lay perſons are not allowed to Baptize; but Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> in his introduction to the life of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> page 27. ſaith, <hi>That the alteration was greater in ſound than ſenſe, it being the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many great Clerks, That any man in caſes of neceſſity (that is extream) who can but pronounce the words of Baptiſm, may paſs in the account and notion of a lawful Miniſter.</hi> A prodigious aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! for a <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Jew</hi> may pronounce the words of Baptiſm, Is he a lawful Miniſter of Baptiſm? did ever any that pretended to reverence the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church thus wreſt her words?</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:105061:35"/>
            <p>But to return to the rite of Baptiſm; we have got a trick to ſprinkle, or to let water fall by drops, but the Church allows no ſuch rite, but moſt expreſly requires pouring, even when the Child is at the weakeſt; and ſeeing in the Baptiſm of Infants the Adminiſtrator is required to dip them if they may well endure it, how comes it to paſs that in the Baptiſm of Adult perſons who are appointed by faſting and prayers to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the receiving of the Sacrament, it is left indifferent to the Miniſters either to dip them in the Font, or pour water on them, though there be a moral certainty, that they may endure dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping well enough? And what Prayers muſt theſe adult perſons uſe to prepare themſelves for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, muſt they make them themſelves, or muſt they be made by the Biſhop or Prieſt? or are there any preparatory Prayers to that purpoſe made already? I wiſh Mr. <hi>D.</hi> would anſwer me theſe queſtions.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Well, but what ſay you in the excuſe of the</hi> Presbyterians, <hi>who as Dr.</hi> Heylin <hi>tells us,</hi> page 293. <hi>would not have their Children Baptized by the names of their Anceſtors,</hi> Richard, Robert, &amp;c. <hi>but by ſome name occurring in the Holy Scriptures, eſpecially in the</hi> Old Teſtament, <hi>becouſe meerly</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, <hi>and not prophaned with any mixture of the</hi> Greek <hi>or</hi> Roman. <hi>Did not</hi> Snape <hi>and</hi> Cartwright <hi>in the Book of Diſcipline agree that the Miniſter in Baptizing Children, ſhould not admit of any ſuch names as had been uſed in the time of</hi> Paganiſm, <hi>the names of Idols and the like? Did they not alſo
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105061:35"/>take an bumor of giving ſuch names unto their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as many of them when they came to age were aſhamed of,</hi> Accepted, Deliverance, Diſcipline, Praiſe God, Reformation, Tribunal, Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As for the Diſcipline of <hi>Jerſy</hi> and <hi>Guernſey,</hi> made by Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> and <hi>Snape,</hi> I never ſaw it but once, when I minded not what was in it; now I know not where to get it, and therefore leave it to Mr. <hi>D.</hi> to anſwer for his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and neighbors. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have not hired me to be their Advocate, I am only for peace, and would not have men made worſe than they be: 'Tis doubtleſs an unjuſt ſcrupuloſity for any man to queſtion the lawfulneſs of calling his Child either <hi>Robert,</hi> or <hi>Richard,</hi> or <hi>Arthur,</hi> or <hi>VVilliam;</hi> but if the Queſtion be not what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but what is expedient, I ſay, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> it is more expedient that Children be named by the names of ſuch perſons as were famous in their generations for piety and learning.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> tells <hi>Baily, Tractatu</hi> 3. page 33. Queſt. 8. <hi>That they uſed diligence to bring Parents to give to their Children names borrowed from them whoſe life was laudable in the Church, that they may be ſtirred up to the imitation of thoſe whoſe name they bear, for ſuch better agree to Chriſtians, than either the ambitious or ſuperſtitious names of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi> He alſo tells us, that in his remembrance a vain-glorious fellow whoſe name was <hi>Le Grand,</hi> would needs name his Child <hi>Alexander,</hi> but the Miniſters refuſed to gratifie his ambition, they would not have a mean fellows Child called
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105061:36"/>
               <hi>Alexander the Great;</hi> but that ever any <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> refuſed to Baptize a Child becauſe it was to be called <hi>Richard,</hi> may well paſs for a Story of Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s (which many times are none of the trueſt) As for the reaſon he gives out of his own head, of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> chuſing <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> names, becauſe the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> is meerly <hi>Hebrew;</hi> it argueth his great ignorance, ſome of the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> Children, before they come from School, know that the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> is not meerly <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Where our Engliſh Tongue can afford happy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, I ſhould think ſuch a compoſition in a Childs name would not make Baptiſm contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor the Impoſer ridiculous; yet I confeſs I ſhould never adviſe any man to name his Child <hi>Praiſe God,</hi> nor, <hi>The Lord is near,</hi> for though he may excuſe himſelf, by the names of <hi>Quod vult Deus, A deo-datus,</hi> uſual in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time, yet it ſavors of affectation to give ſuch names, and it may occaſion the taking of the Lords name in vain, nor do I find that <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted themſelves in ſuch names. <hi>Accepted</hi> was the name of Dr. <hi>Frewen</hi> late Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> was he ever aſhamed of it? or had he any reaſon to be aſhamed of it? or was his Father a <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian?</hi> Let the Church Books from 1582 be ſearched, and it will be found to the ſhame of this Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have given ſuch names to their Children as other people did, and that none of their Children are called by ſuch uncouth names as are mentioned in the Objection.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:105061:36"/>
            <p>My next task is to give in a Catalogue of Mr. <hi>D</hi>'s impertinencies, which are indeed many, and too many to be inſiſted on particularly.</p>
            <p>Page 51. <hi>He gives us ſome ſayings of ſome Churches againſt Sacriledg:</hi> A thing that hath been done more copiouſly by Dr. <hi>John Hoornbeck</hi> in his examination of the Popes Bull, ſent forth to nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the peace of <hi>Germany;</hi> and if Mr. <hi>D.</hi> pleaſe, he may read a very ſmart Diſcourſe againſt the ſin of Sacriledg in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> defence of the <hi>VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesterſhire</hi> Petition. If Anceſtors through miſtake have given maintenance to Idolatrous uſes, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates may convert that maintenance to uſes truly pious. If there be a true ſuperfluity of Church revenues for ſome one good uſe, Magiſtrates may out of that ſuperfluity provide for ſome other good uſe. If the Soveraign power pleaſe in caſes of true neceſſity, to make uſe of Church-mens Lands, as well as others, to maintain the Nation againſt fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Invaſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what is there in ſuch an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on blame-worthy? Theſe and ſuch like caſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, I profeſs I know not the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> alive or dead, that was not againſt the alienation of Church-Lands. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> tells us, <hi>he ſaw ſome</hi> Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian <hi>Miniſters made nothing of purchaſing and detaining Church-Lands,</hi> and in his Margin nameth Dr. <hi>Burges;</hi> ſo that it ſeemeth, Dr. <hi>Burges is ſome Presbyterian Miniſters:</hi> But he ought before he ſo called him, to prove that he was ſo much as <hi>one Presbyterian Miniſter;</hi> he was not that Dr. <hi>Burges,</hi> of whom we heard before, that made the Book againſt Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> his reply to Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:105061:37"/>but he was the Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> that overſaw that Book in the Preſs, and adorned its Margin to make the reading more pleaſant and delightful; and he was that Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> who did write for Baptiſmal Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration (a Doctrine diſtaſtful to the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>). He took the Covenant indeed, but not (as I have heard) till he was like to be turned out of the Aſſembly for not taking it. It is true, that once he made a Speech againſt the continuance of <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters,</hi> but in that Speech he declared <hi>the utter unlawfulneſs of converting their Lands to any private mans uſe;</hi> it ſeems that he himſelf after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards purchaſed ſomething belonging to the Dean of <hi>VVells,</hi> intending to ſettle it on his Children; how he could ſatisfie his Conſcience ſo to do I know not; perhaps when he ſaw that that part of the Houſe of Commons which favoured <hi>Presbytery</hi> was ſecluded, and that Deans and Chapters Lands deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mend poor Livings, muſt be ſold for other uſes, he reſolved to do as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith a Dog which he knew at <hi>Erford</hi> did, when he could defend his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters diſh of meat from other Dogs no longer, <hi>viz.</hi> got as good a ſhare of the prey as he could.

               <hi>England</hi> hath ſuffered much by mens underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to fetch their Divinity out of the Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, which are always righteous, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hidden.</p>
            <p>A greater noiſe is made in ſome Books, on the account of the Aſſemblies Annotations; in the which, or in the firſt Edition of which, it is ſaid, <hi>Nothing is to be found againſt Sacriledg;</hi> and it is eaſily acknowledged, that in the Aſſemblies An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations nothing is to be found againſt Sacriledg, for the Aſſemblies Annotations are not to be found: But as for the <hi>Engliſh Notes</hi> made by ſundry Divines, who were all of them before the Wars, Conformiſts, and commonly miſcalled the <hi>Aſſemblies Annotations;</hi> and for the Aſſembly it ſelf, hear an ingenuous, but cordial and through-paced Son of the Church, in a Diſcourſe entituled, <hi>Church-Lands not to be ſold,</hi> printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1648. he quotes with approbation the Note on <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.22. p. 14. having ſpoken p. 27. of honeſt Mr. <hi>Geree,</hi> who avers, <hi>That to aboliſh Prelacy, and to ſeize the Lands of the Prelates to any private or civil intereſt, undoubtedly could not want ſtain nor guilt:</hi> he adds, <hi>I am confident, by the diſcourſe I have had with the moſt able of the Aſſembly of Divines at</hi> Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <hi>that at the leaſt three parts, if not all of them, are of the ſame judgment; and that they would openly profeſs as much, if they were put to anſwer the queſtion.</hi> The ſame Author quotes with appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation the Note on <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. and on <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8, 9.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105061:38"/>and grief of the Univerſity of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and the Miniſters of the bounds, who had great intereſt therein.

            <p>A ſecond impertinence relates to <hi>Confirmation,</hi> which Mr. <hi>D.</hi> p. 43. ſaith, <hi>he finds uſed in almoſt all Reformed Churches, in ſome with greater, in ſome with leſſer ſolemnity.</hi> To what purpoſe doth he tell us this? Would he have the world believe, that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are againſt Confirmation? or that they do not earneſtly deſire it? Have not Mr. <hi>Hanmer</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> written books to ſhew the uſefulneſs and neceſſity of it? Do not ſome of them ground it on <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. and draw thence an argument for Infant-baptiſm? Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> knows they do, and ſo do many others of the <hi>Antipaedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts.</hi> For my part I bleſs God that hath put it into the hearts of the Convocation, to inſert into this laſt Edition of the Liturgy, a queſtion to be propounded to thoſe who are confirmed: let con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be made never to confirm any but thoſe who are well inſtructed in the Church Catechiſm, and are well reported of for their converſation, and I ſhall think then that nothing is to be blamed in our order for admiſſion to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. But if men will pretend a great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105061:39"/>to Confirmation, and yet ſuffer the far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Nation to communicate uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; and if Biſhops will confirm perſons groſly ignorant and ſcandalous in the higheſt degree, and never require Certificates from the Miniſters of thoſe Pariſhes to which they belong, God forbid that I ſhould juſtifie them.</p>
            <p>The only queſtion conſiderable about Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, betwixt thoſe called <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and their adverſaries, is concerning the Miniſter thereof: <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ſay. <hi>That no Law of God hath appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated it to a Biſhop ſtrictly ſo called.</hi> If Mr. <hi>D.</hi> can ſhew us any ſuch Law, or if he can prove that in all or in any Reformed Church, a meer <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is not accounted to have power to confirm, as well as to baptize, he ſhall do ſomething; let him therefore ſhew himſelf a man, and undertake this work, and when he hath his hand in, let him alſo wipe off a blot thrown upon the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Geneva</hi> by Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> with the Pen of a virulent Papiſt, <hi>VVilliam Reynolds,</hi> Hiſtory of Presby. <hi>pag.</hi> 283. <hi>viz.</hi> That, 1576, <hi>the Common-prayer-Book was Printed by</hi> Richard Jugg <hi>the Queens Printer, the whole order of private Baptiſm, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of Children being omitted, which omiſſion was deſigned to bring the Church of</hi> England <hi>into ſome Conformity to the deſired Orders of</hi> Geneva.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 47. he is ſo prodigal of his Ink and Paper, as to tell us, <hi>That in all reformed Churches Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is celebrated in the publick Congregation, and by the Miniſter.</hi> This may be true of all reformed Churches in reference to their own Members, at leaſt I hope it is; but if he ſhould intend to aſſert,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105061:39"/>That Reformed Churches allow not that any who are conſtant livers in the ſame Cities with them, ſhall be married otherwiſe than by the Miniſters, and in the Church, he is miſtaken. Yet let it be ſuppoſed, that Papiſts, dwelling with Proteſtants, are forced to marry in the Church, and to make uſe of a Miniſter; what is this to the Presbyterians? The compoſers of the Directory ſay, <hi>VVe judge it expedient that Marriage be ſolemnized by a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter of the word, that he may counſel them and pray for them;</hi> In the ſaid directory, care alſo is taken, <hi>that before any marriage the perſons intent of marriage be publiſhed by the Miniſter three ſeveral ſabbath days in the congregation at the place, or places of their moſt uſual and conſtant abode re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, and all Miniſters are to have ſufficient teſtimony of this publication before they proceed to ſolemnize Marriage.</hi> By the Liturgy alſo ſufficient proviſion is made that of all that are to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, the Bannes be publiſhed in the Church, three ſeveral ſundays, or Holy days in the time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſervice, but any one, that hath mony may have a licence to be Married without any ſuch publication of Bannes, by which means great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences have ariſen in Church and State. Care alſo is taken by the 62 Canon of 1603. <q>That none ſhall be married, unleſs the Parents, or Governors of the parties to be married being under the age of twenty one, ſhall either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, or by ſufficient teſtimony, ſignifie their conſent given to the ſaid marriage. The directory is ſomewhat more ſtrict,</q> requiring, <hi>that perſons though of age ſhall be bound to have a Certificate of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105061:40"/>their Parents conſent, if it be their firſt marriage:</hi> And really it ſeems but rational, that a man and a woman, though of the age of Thirty, if never married before, ſhould be bound to ſignifie their Parents conſent, before any Miniſter adventure to marry them.</p>
            <p>The greateſt differences I find among Proteſtants about Marriage, are reducible to Two Heads:</p>
            <p n="1">1. We ſay here in <hi>England, That though Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren he bound to ask the conſent of Parents, yet if the marriage be made, no ſuch conſent asked or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the marriage is valid; fieri non debet, factum valet,</hi> is our Rule; but beyond Seas, <hi>ſuch marriages are by many held to be void and of no effect.</hi> Mr. <hi>D.</hi> hath ſo many obligations laid on him by our Church, that it would be but gratitude to take her part, and to anſwer the Arguments of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Church hath thought meet <hi>to prohibit marriage for certain times and ſeaſons, which are particularized in our common Almanacks.</hi> Other Churches leave it free to perſons to marry all the year about, to theſe the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they ſay marriage is not to be forbidden at any time, unleſs on ſuch days, in which God calls to <hi>faſting, weeping, mourning;</hi> to confirm them in this opinion, they had the judgment of a whole Convocation in <hi>England</hi> aſſembled in the year 1575, agreeing, <hi>That Biſhops ſhould take order that it be publiſhed and declared in every Pariſh Church within their Dioceſſes, that marriage might be ſolemnized at all times of the year;</hi> but though the Church thought meet to put this Article into
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105061:40"/>the Book, the Head of the Church, Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> did not ſo think, and therefore ſuffered it not to be Printed. Dr. <hi>Heyl.</hi> Hiſt. of <hi>Presb.</hi> 282, 283.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Ay, but there are ſome who ſcruple the Ring in Marriage, which Mr.</hi> D. <hi>ſaith is uſed in</hi> Heſſen, Poland, Lithuania.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> If there be any ſuch, the more is the pity, for rational ground of ſcruple there is none, any more than there is to ſcruple taking ſeiſin by a Turf: Nor do I know any one <hi>Presbyterian</hi> now living, that doth ſcruple the uſe of a Ring in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p>Pag. 48. we are informed by Mr. <hi>D. That in moſt places of the Reformed Churches, they have Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Sermons, in</hi> Hungary <hi>and</hi> Tranſilvania, <hi>two or three, in</hi> Bohemia <hi>but one, and that at the</hi> Grave. As if he would ſuggeſt to us, that either <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> are againſt Funeral Sermons, or the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal extreamly for them; whereas the truth is, there never were more Funeral Sermons than in thoſe days, when the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had their Churches and Pulpits; and now that they are thruſt out, when any one of them dye, 'tis ſeldom but ſome body <hi>is hired to Preach a Sermon,</hi> I ſay, <hi>hired,</hi> for they are as rare as Black Swans, that will Preach a Funeral Sermon under an Angel or a Noble. And whereas he tells us, <hi>ibid. of the Miniſter with ſinging Boys going before the Corps;</hi> he knows, that in <hi>England</hi> we have ſinging Boys but in few places, ſcarce any where but in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals, which do not uſe to ſend their ſinging Boys to go before the Corps at every Funeral.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105061:41"/>Civil reſpects, or differences at Burials may be ſuted to the rank and condition of the party deceaſed, whiles he was living; as for the Religious part of Funerals, why ſhould it not be alike to all that have attained like precious faith? Doth Mr. <hi>D.</hi> know any Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es where only the moneyed Chriſtians are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with Sermons; the poor being laid in their graves without any? If he did not, why would he lay open the nakedneſs of his Fathers, why would he tempt ſtrangers to think, that with them there is reſpect of perſons? The <hi>Scots</hi> ſay, Either let us have Sermons at all Funerals, or at none, ſo ſay the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> ſo I ſuppoſe the <hi>French</hi> either ſay or think: But Mr. <hi>D.</hi> Page 49. quotes a ſcrap of a Letter from Monſieur <hi>Drelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> ſaying, <hi>I am ſo far from allowing the cuſtom of the Reformed Churches of this Kingdom, where the Miniſters are ſilent at dead mens Burials, that I would think it unſufferable were it not for the condition under which we live.</hi> I believe Mr. <hi>Dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lincourt,</hi> if he be ſtill alive, thinks Mr. <hi>D.</hi> dealt not civilly with him, in publiſhing this piece of his Letter, for he ſure took no delight to let the world know, that he accounted the cuſtom of the <hi>Holland</hi> Churches unſufferable, eſpecially ſeeing the <hi>French</hi> Churches in <hi>Holland</hi> comply with them, and yet cannot plead that they fear perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. The ſame <hi>Drelincourt,</hi> if we may believe Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſaid, that he found upon peruſal of the Common Prayer Book office for Burial of the dead, <hi>nothing that was contrary to piety, or pure Doctrine, and the ſervice of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:105061:41"/>
            <p>Is not this a rare commendation of the Liturgy, that it hath nothing in it contrary to piety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what Common prayer Book did this learned Divine read over? in all but this laſt there were expreſſions to be uſed at Burials, that were apt to harden men in their impenitence, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are now either changed, or left quite out. At preſent I know little liable to exception, ſave only, that Burial ſeems appropriated to a Prieſt: may a Deacon Baptiſe and Preach, and may he not bury our dead out of our ſight? In the Old Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, it was ſaid, <hi>the Miniſter meeting the Corps at the Church ſtile ſhall ſay;</hi> in this laſt edition of the Liturgy it is ſaid <hi>the Prieſts and Clerks,</hi> and ſo throughout the whole Office we have no other word but <hi>Prieſt,</hi> which is never applied to any that are but Deacons; there is ſome myſtery in this which Mr. <hi>D.</hi> can expound, or elſe take no notice of. 2. By the Liturgy the form of Burial is not to be uſed <hi>for any that dye unbaptized.</hi> What's the meaning of this? If Chriſtian Parents loſe a child before they can get it to be baptized, muſt they, to all other their ſorrow, have this alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That their child ſhall not have Chriſtian b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

How will Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> after all the pains he hath taken to deſend the Liturgy, brook this? 3. Seeing the Office is to be read at the burial of all baptized, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excommunicate nor murderers of themſelves, why is the Prieſt appointed to ſay, <hi>His <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What if he be by God ſtruck dead with an oath or blaſphemy upon his tongues end? muſt we uſe the very ſame words for him, that we uſe for one that led a moſt Chriſtian life, and died a comfortable death? I have much more charity for ſome that laid violent hands on themſelves, than for thoſe who contrary to all laws of God and man, do dye in Duels by the ſword of another?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 50. he hath other words of <hi>Drelincourts</hi> as little to purpoſe, <hi>If we were permitted,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to preach at</hi> Paris, <hi>and there to miniſter the holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, I am of this perſwaſion, that it would be a pious and charitable work to give that comfort to thoſe poor ſick perſons who have kept their bed for many years, and are not able to go as far as</hi> Charenton, <hi>which is the place of our ordinary exerciſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> This is a marvellous wary ſpeech, 1. <hi>If they were permitted.</hi> 2. <hi>If they were permitted both to preach and adminiſter the Sacrament.</hi> 3. Then, <hi>it would be pious and charitable to give the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuch as have kept their beds for many years.</hi> Can <hi>Mr. D.</hi> think that the <hi>Engliſh Presbyterians</hi> will be offended at a perſwaſion thus qualified? It may rather be queſtioned, Whether ſome of them would not judg it charitable and pious to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacrament in ſuch caſes, though they had no permiſſion from the King; at leaſt it may be conceived, that they would adventure, if they ſhould be permitted only to adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though no leave were given them to preach; for a Sermon is not of the eſſence of a Sacrament;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105061:42"/>and I deem they would perform this act of charity and piety to ſuch as had been confined to their beds, though only for one or two years, which are not many. There is not one word in all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory againſt private Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 40. <hi>Mr. D.</hi> gives us notice, <hi>That in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemian Churches, the people do alway ſay Amen at the end of the Prayers, in the ſame manner that we do here in England.</hi> Which is ſo far from croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that they, as many think, by their good will, would have the people ſay nothing but <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 39. he fancieth he may put the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to ſilence, by <hi>telling them of Churches that ſing Hymns and ſpiritual ſongs, beſides Pſalms.</hi> But he may know, that <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are as much at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſing any godly Hymn or ſpiritual Song, as he himſelf is. Let him but procure the <hi>Te Deum</hi> or the Lords prayer to be ſet to ordinary times, and then he ſhall ſee whether the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> will make any ſcruple for conſcience-ſake to ſing thoſe forms, or the three Creeds which are ſaid to be ſet with muſical notes in the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches, but not ſung by the <hi>French</hi> Churches, by reaſon both the Rhime and the language are ſomething courſe and old. <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are not ſo dainty, they continue to ſing the old <hi>Pſalms,</hi> though the language and rhime be odd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth in many places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 183. he goes about to ſtab the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> with a declaration of a National Synod met at <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geac</hi> 1579. What is the declaration? Why, it is a <hi>declaration againſt reading verſes aloud before they
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105061:43"/>be ſung, as being inept, threatning cenſure to ſuch Churches as uſed it.</hi> The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> think this cuſtom unfit, and therefore exhorted all Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to get Pſalm-books, and to learn to read; they allowed reading of Pſalms line by line, only for neceſſity, when ignorance had prevailed ſo far, that many in moſt Congregations could not read at all. Let <hi>Mr. D.</hi> but take care that all be taught to read, or learn the pſalms without book, and I dare half undertake for <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> they ſhall leave off ſo inept or unmeet a cuſtom. Till then, they, and Epiſcopal men too, muſt do as they can, and remember that they are debtors to the unwiſe as well as wiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 22. <hi>Mr. D.</hi> makes mention of Churches, <hi>whoſe Miniſters wear commonly either a long cloak, or a gown and long cap; nay,</hi> Calvin (ſaith he) <hi>did wear a gown and a cap, as often as he taught ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Divinity-School, or in the Church at</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva. If <hi>Presbyterians</hi> do not wear a cap when they teach in the church, they may eaſily be pardoned by <hi>Mr. D.</hi> As for a gown, let him but get them liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to preach, and they will promiſe never to need his pardon for want of that. I am ſure I have ſeen thoſe whom the Parliament ſent down to <hi>Cambridg</hi> into the places of ſuch as were ejected, preach both in gowns and hoods, and ſo I have heard they did at <hi>Oxford</hi> when they preached <hi>Latin</hi> Sermons; for which they have been ſcolded at by filly women, as <hi>Calvin</hi> was by the Wife of <hi>Frumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgot another Impertinence, p. 37. <hi>The French Churches require that the Miniſters,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:105061:43"/>who ought to uſe Impoſition of hands, upon thoſe that are to be admitted to the miniſtry among them, ſhould pray standing on that occaſion, the new received Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and the Congregation kneeling at the ſame time.</hi> This was the conſtant practice of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as to Ordainers and Ordained, in all places where I have been, or of which I have heard. As for the people, they were commonly ſo numerous at Ordinations, that they could not without huge inconvenience kneel. I alſo find that I have paſſed over ſomething, page 32. <q>They have the Ten Commandments in Letters of Gold upon two great Tables where they are able to be at the charge of it; and in ſome places they have alſo the Creed and the Lords Prayer in the ſame manner, conformable to one of the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</q> Who are meant by <hi>they,</hi> I cannot tell; the precedent words were, in Princes Chappels in <hi>Germany,</hi> and other parts they have them (<hi>i. e.</hi> Chalices) gilt. Are there any Princes in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> or other parts who cannot be at the charge of having the Ten Commandments in Letters of Gold upon two great Tables? Or doth Mr. <hi>D.</hi> mean the <hi>French</hi> Churches, as many as have ability, do ſet up the Commandments in Letters of Gold upon two great Tables? If ſo, I doubt he wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Conſcience. But let it be ſuppoſed that in all <hi>French</hi> Churches that are not very poor, the Ten Commandments are ſet up in Letters of Gold, what mean thoſe words, in ſome places they have alſo the Creed and the Lords Prayer in the ſame manner, conformable to one of the conſtitutions of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105061:44"/>the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Have the rich <hi>French</hi> Churches, the Lords Prayer and Creed on two Tables, and in Letters of Gold? If they have not, why is it ſaid that they have the Creed and Lords Prayer in the ſame manner? The Churches of <hi>France</hi> I am certain may be conformable enough to the conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and yet not have either the Commandments in Two Tables or in Letters of Gold; for all the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requires, is but <hi>that the Ten Commandments be ſet upon the Eaſt-end of every Church and Chappel, where the people may beſt ſee and read the ſame, and other choſen ſentences written upon the walls of the ſaid Churches and Chappels in convenient places.</hi> Here is no mention of two great Tables, no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Letters of Gold, no mention of Creed or Lords Prayer.</p>
            <p>But why did Mr. <hi>D.</hi> trouble himſelf to bring in all, or any of this Stuff? Did <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the lawfulneſs or expedience of having either the Decalogue, or Creed, or Lords Prayer, ſet upon conſpicuous places in the Temple? I know an eminent Nonconformiſt now living, who was wont to rejoyce that the Painter had ſet the Lords Prayer juſt over againſt his Pulpit, that if it had hapned he had been out, he might by his eyes help himſelf. Had the Creed been ſo placed it had been well for Mr. <hi>D.</hi> for they ſay, that not long ſince, he was horribly out in repeating the Articles of Faith after Sermon.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this Catalogue of Impertinencies with Mr. <hi>D</hi>'s ſtories concerning reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Convocations of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> do conſiſt of an upper and lower Houſe; and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105061:50"/>though the Upper Houſe conſiſts but of Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Biſhops, yet the Lower conſiſts of the inferior Clergy, Deans, Prebendaries, Arch-dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons and Proctors of the Clergy. P. 116. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> calls our Convocations <hi>a Council conſiſting of above ſixſcore reverend, grave, and learned Divines, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of many thouſands, whereof twenty-ſix are Archbiſhops and Biſhops, a greater number Deans, and Prebends, and Archdeacons:</hi> Which ſhews he underſtandeth not the frame and conſtitution of our Convocations, though they be the Church-Repreſentative, that he pretends to write for. The Convocation for the very Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> (beſides which, there is one for the Province of <hi>York</hi>) conſiſts of an Archbiſhop, twenty-one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops for the Upper Houſe; the Lower Houſe conſiſt; of Deans twenty-two, Prebendaries twenty-four. Arch deacons fifty-four, Clerks repreſenting the Clergy, forty-four; ſo that the very Lower Houſe for this one Province, conſiſts of One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred forty-four perſons. But how <hi>theſe are choſen out of many thouſands, they are men of rare facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that can underſtand.</hi> If we ſpeak of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Convocation, neither Biſhops, nor Deans, nor Arch-deacons, are choſen to it, but come of courſe, juſt as Peers do to the Houſe of Lords. As for the Prebends, they are choſen only by the Chapters, which I hope are not many thouſands; the Dioceſan Clergy may be ſaid to be choſen out of many thouſands; but they for the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> are but forty-four. It may be <hi>Mr. D.</hi> meant that theſe Divines are choſen to their Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties out of many thouſands; but that will be a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105061:50"/>groſſer untruth than the other: for Biſhops are choſen by the Dean and Chapter of that Church to which they are ſent, but they have not many thouſands to chuſe out of; there is but one nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to be choſen, and him I believe the Dean and Chapter muſt chuſe, and return his Election; and the Election being returned and ratified by Royal aſſent, the Metropolitan muſt either conſecrate or confirm, as occaſion requireth. That which the <hi>Puritans</hi> were wont to complain of, was the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of the Repreſentative; they ſay for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, If all who are choſen by the Dioceſan Clergy for the whole Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> ſhould deſire a Reformation, yet they could not carry it; becauſe the Arch-deacons who are the Biſhops creatures, as being choſen ſolely by them, are ten in number more than they; and they alſo were wont to ſay, That the Biſhops would take on them to nominate the two Clerks for the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; and if it be ſo, they ſaid it was in effect all one as if the Convocation had conſiſted only of Biſhops. This notwithſtanding, Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> in his <hi>Epiſcopacy aſſerted,</hi> ſeems to envy the Presbyters ſo much as ſitting in Councils: <hi>'Tis evident,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Epiſc. aſſert.</hi> p. 283.) <hi>that the Laws of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and of the Catholick Church, were made by Conventions of Biſhops, without the intervening or concurrence of Presbyters, or any elſe, for ſentence and deciſion; the inſtances of this are juſt as many as there are Councils.</hi> The pariſhes of both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces in <hi>England,</hi> are above nine thouſand two hundred; the paſtors of theſe pariſhes ſend about Fifty-two to repreſent them and in the very Houſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105061:51"/>where they ſit, there are above twice as many (in whoſe election they were no way concerned) that have equal votes with them; and beſides, there is an Upper Houſe of Biſhops. Mr. <hi>Durell</hi> would exceed <hi>Plutarch</hi> himſelf, if he could find in any Reformed Church a parallel. Let him try how ſuch a Synod as this will hit with that which the <hi>Theſes</hi> of <hi>Saumur</hi> ſay concerning Councils.</p>
            <p>But I have almoſt forgotten my ſelf. Let Mr. <hi>D.</hi> go on to wipe off falſe aſperſions caſt on our Biſhops. P. 86. <hi>Men beyond the ſeas are told that every one of our Biſhops is a Pope, nay more than a Pope in his Dioceſs; preſcribing and impoſing of himſelf what he pleaſeth to his Clergy; whereas eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Biſhops authority is limited by his ſubſcription to the</hi> 39 <hi>articles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by the Conſtitutions and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons Eccleſiaſtical, and by the Laws of the Land, according to the preſcript whereof he is to rule his dicceſs, and no otherwiſe; calling always to joyn with him in impoſition of hands, and other matters of weighty concernment, ſome of the Prebends of his Cathedral, or other grave Miniſters of the Dioceſs.</hi> Certainly this Preacher knows not what a Pope is, if he think that what theſe calumniators report of the Biſhops, makes them worſe than Popes. But let them deſerve to keep the Whetſtone for their tale, Mr. <hi>D.</hi> will have it from them again; for nothing is more falſe, <hi>than that by any Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Laws Biſhops are bound to call unto them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prebends or grave Miniſters to joyn with them in impoſition of hands, and in all other weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> The Biſhops lay on hands in confirmation of children, who is to joyn with him in that Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:105061:51"/>They lay on hands when they ordain Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, are they to call any to joyn with them in that impoſition of hands?</p>
            <p>Ay, but they cannot ordain a Presbyter regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, unleſs ſome Presbyters joyn with them in laying on of hands.</p>
            <p>Really they cannot: but now the queſtion is, What the hands of the Presbyters ſignifie? And truly if we ask thoſe that ſtickle for Hierarchy, they will ſay, they ſignifie juſt nothing, or next to nothing: this conjunction of Presbyters is not <hi>ad eſſentiam operis,</hi> but <hi>ad dignitatem ſacerdotii. The Presbyters hands confer nothing of the power of Order upon the party ordained, but only teſtifie their conſent unto the buſineſs, and approbation of the man.</hi> So <hi>Dr. Heylin</hi> Hiſtory of Epiſcopacy, p. 162. and to the ſame purpoſe Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> in <hi>Epiſcopacy aſſerted.</hi> Is not the Presbytery fairly advanced? it may do what the Laity did, or at leaſt may do, teſtifie conſent and approbation of the man? Again, the ſuſpenſion of a Miniſter is a weighty thing; who is appointed to joyn with the Biſhop in this? Excommunication alſo is a weighty thing; Who muſt joyn with the Biſhop in that? Finally, Mr. <hi>D.</hi> would oblige me greatly if he would fully ſatisfie me what Canons and Conſtitutions the Biſhops are to govern their Clergy by. I hope no Canons are in force but thoſe of 1603. which I am ſure are more than be well obſerved; but there were Legatine Canons in number Seventy-ſeven, made by <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Otho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone;</hi> and Provincial Canons made under <hi>Stephen Langthon</hi> and <hi>Henry Chichly</hi> Archbiſhops of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:105061:52"/>digeſted into a body by <hi>William Lindwood,</hi> as the former were by <hi>John Mon,</hi> Canon of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln;</hi> and ſome ſay, that ſo much of all theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons as is not contrary to the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Land, is ſtill in force; if ſo, as ſo it may be for ought I know, then I am ſure a great many of the Clergy know not how they are to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned; but if any ſhould know all Canons and Conſtitutions, and underſtand that the Biſhop pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes things contrary to all Law and Canons, what then? Why then there lyes an Appeal, or a Prohibition may be obtained, to the coſt of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which a poor Countrey-Vicar can eaſily raiſe his purſe.</p>
            <p>P. 87. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> is at his old trade of over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>for he deſcribeth Monſieur</hi> Goyon <hi>to be a man as well verſed in antiquity, as is poſſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet neither he nor I can tell the bounds of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility in the skill of antiquity; and perhaps both of us can tell of ſome that are more skilful in Church-Hiſtory than this <hi>Monſieur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>P. 103. The Church of <hi>England</hi> is be-lied, for of her it is ſaid, that ſhe holdeth ſubordination of Miniſters in the Chriſtian Church, to be of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical, nay of Divine Inſtitution, having (as ſhe conceiveth) for grounds of this her judgment, beſide Scripture, the practice of the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in their times, of the Univerſal Church ever ſince, until this latter age; and which is more, of Chriſt himſelf, who ordained the Apoſtles and the Seventy, in an imparity, as two diſtinct Orders of Miniſters in his Church; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe doth but ſimply aſſert the lawfulneſs of her own Government.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:105061:52"/>
            <p>Certainly this man doth not pretend to know the conceptions of our Church, till they be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; and the Church hath no where declared her conceptions to be theſe, <hi>That ſubordination of Miniſters, beſide Scripture, is grounded on the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Apoſtles, and of Chriſt himſelf.</hi> The practice of the Apoſtles, and of Chriſt, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Scripture, but recorded in Scripture; nor doth the Church any where ſay that Chriſt inſtituted the Apoſtles and the Seventy as two diſtinct Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Miniſters in his Church; if ſhe do, then Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> did not know her mind, or elſe plainly contradicts her.</p>
            <p>P. 144. contains no fewer than four calumnies againſt <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> which muſt be manifeſted in their order.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Presbyterians had no ſet-forms, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed would receive any, whether for Common-prayer or for adminiſtration of Sacraments, Matrimony,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I believe ſome <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had ſet-forms for all theſe; and I am ſure they do not account it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to receive ſet-forms for any of theſe, only they may, and ſome of them do judge it inexpedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to have Miniſters ſo tied up in all theſe, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the leaſt to vary, either by addition or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction. I never heard of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred Baptiſm in any other form of words than thoſe appointed in the Liturgy. <hi>I baptize in the Name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt;</hi> nor the Lords Supper in any other form of words but what is Scriptural; nor Marriage but in a ſet-form, either that in the Common-prayer-book, or that in the Directory.</p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:105061:53"/>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>For a long time many of them had left off the uſe of that very form our Lord hath taught us,</hi> p. 37. He had ſaid, <hi>That moſt, if not all Directorians, had left out of their Service, for a long time, that moſt complete, moſt divine form of prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Paget,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hodges,</hi> have printed Apologies for the uſe of the Lords prayer; hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of thoſe who now ſuffer deprivation, have thouſands of witneſſes that they have uſed it in their Churches and in their Families, on Sundays, on Faſting-days, and yet they muſt have this filth thrown into their diſh. However, on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on let us try what Mr. <hi>D.</hi> can ſay: Suppoſe ſome <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had never uſed this prayer in the Pulpit, but only at the Lords Supper, had they not preſident in the ancient Church to juſtifie them in ſo doing? yea, ſuppoſe ſome ſhould ſay that it were no ſin never to uſe this prayer, provided a man took it as the pattern of his prayer, how would Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſtop their mouths, and prove them tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors? In his Sermon p. 26. he brings the words <hi>Luke</hi> 11. <hi>When ye pray, ſay;</hi> and this place is commonly urged, but perhaps is not ſo ſtrong as ſome imagine it to be, at leaſt when managed as they manage it: for I ask, What is the meaning of, <hi>When ye pray, ſay?</hi> Is the meaning, <hi>When ye pray, ſay after this manner,</hi> or <hi>ſay theſe words?</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> but <hi>after this manner,</hi> then the ſword is not long enough to reach Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> and his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for they pretend to ſay after that manner, (and not to conceal any part of the truth, the <hi>Syriack</hi> tranſlation in <hi>Luke</hi> requires it to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, <hi>ſic,</hi> or <hi>ad hunc modum eſtote dicentes</hi>), but
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105061:53"/>let the words mean, <hi>ſay theſe words,</hi> then I ask, Whether the words in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> or St. <hi>Luke?</hi> If the words that occur in <hi>Luke,</hi> then we have no precept for the Doxology, as it is in <hi>Matthew.</hi> And really I have wondred what they meant, who were wont to ſay at the concluſion of their Pulpit-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>In his name and in his words we further pray, ſaying as he hath taught us; and yet had never ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied themſelves, that the Doxology which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in that caſe uſed was of our Lords own indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. There is reaſon</hi> (ſaith Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>) <hi>to believe that the words of Doxology came in out of the</hi> Greek <hi>Liturgies; and that the ancienteſt</hi> Greek <hi>Copies have them not,</hi> Pract. Cat. lib. 3. ſect. 2. <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> had ſaid as much before. Thoſe who believe theſe two Learned men, had need alter the form of words with which they uſher in the Lords Prayer. 'Tis not ſafe to aſcribe to Chriſt any thing but what is his; but how ſhall a man know that the copies in which the Doxology is wanting, are the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaith he found the Doxology in all the Greek Copies: <hi>Lucas Brugenſis,</hi> that it was in all the Greek <hi>Pariſian</hi> Copies but one. And if one look into the various readings collected in our late <hi>Polyglot</hi> Bibles, he ſhall find the Copies that want theſe words of Doxology, to be but few; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Grotius</hi> hath got no credit by ſaying, <hi>Seeing that they are not extant in the moſt ancient</hi> Greek <hi>Copies, but are extant in the</hi> Syriack, Arabick, <hi>and</hi> Latin <hi>Context, we may learn not only that the</hi> Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick <hi>and</hi> Latin <hi>Verſion, but alſo the</hi> Syriack, <hi>was made after that the Liturgy of the Churches was
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105061:54"/>brought into a certain form.</hi> For the Doxology is not in ſome <hi>Arabick</hi> Verſions, not in that which is inſerted into the <hi>Polyglot</hi> Bibles. If the <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> (which <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaw) had put in the Doxology out of the <hi>Greek</hi> Liturgies, why did they not alſo put it in in the Goſpel of <hi>Luke?</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it could be made appear that the <hi>Greek</hi> Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies varied, I know not how he can anſwer this queſtion. Let me add this caution to young Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that they be not too haſty to give credit to every Copy that ſome men magnifie. That <hi>Syriack</hi> Tranſlation which is followed in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our <hi>Polyglot</hi> Bibles, if it were the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteſt, would be a good argument of the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Feſtivals or Holy-days; but the Tranſlation which <hi>Immanuel Tremelius</hi> followed, for ought I know may be much ancienter; and in it there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth no ſuch diſtinction of days. To return to St. <hi>Luke,</hi> if his <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> import that we muſt uſe his very words in <hi>Greek,</hi> or words in our language as near as may be to his, then muſt we not follow our Liturgy; for though it ſometimes inſerts the Doxology, and ſometimes omits it, yet it never tranſlateth the Lords Prayer according to St. <hi>Luke; Give us this day our daily bread, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our treſpaſſes as we forgive them that tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſs againſt us;</hi> is not to tranſlate, but paraphraſe on St. <hi>Luke.</hi> It is a little odd, that in the whole Liturgy the Lords Prayer ſhould never be put in the ſame words that are uſed in all our Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Bibles that were authorized, whether new or old. Will Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſay, If Chriſt bid us uſe theſe very words, that we may uſe other of like
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:105061:54"/>nature and import; and yet that if the Church bid us uſe her words, that we muſt uſe them and no other? The <hi>Browniſt</hi> will ſay the Church may well allow as much liberty as ſhe taketh. Beſides, what aſſurance can Mr. <hi>D.</hi> give the <hi>Browniſts</hi> what words the Lord Jeſus uſed when his diſciples deſired him to teach them how to pray? <hi>Grotius</hi> the great, ſaith, <hi>It is credible, that ſeveral things are thrown into the</hi> Greek <hi>copies of St.</hi> Luke, <hi>out of St.</hi> Matthew; and the things he ſuppoſeth to be thruſt in, are all that are left out of the old La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin copies; if ſo, the Lords Prayer muſt be made much ſhorter than ever it is made in our Liturgy; we muſt not ſay <hi>which art in heaven;</hi> nor <hi>thy will be done as in heaven, ſo on earth;</hi> nor, <hi>but deliver us from evil.</hi> The <hi>Browniſt</hi> hath not yet done with Mr. <hi>D.</hi> but will ask him how often he is bound to ſay the Lords Prayer by virtue of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: p. 27. of his Sermon he tells them, that this and another reaſon by him there mentioned, <hi>obliged thoſe Proteſtants which follow the</hi> Auguſtane <hi>Confeſſion, and thoſe of the Reformed Churches of</hi> Holland. <hi>to ſay it ordinarily before and after meals, at the end of their Graces.</hi> Had theſe men reaſon to think themſelves obliged to this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom? If they had, then is Mr. <hi>D.</hi> obliged alſo, and ſins every time he doth not uſe the Lords Prayer before and after meals: if it were their miſtake to think themſelves obliged, how will he give ſecurity that he is not miſtaken in counting himſelf obliged to ſay a <hi>Pater noſter</hi> every time that he bends his knee to God in prayer, either in the beginning, or middle, or end of his prayer?
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105061:55"/>If he plead a command of Chriſt, as he doth in that Sermon, he muſt prove the <hi>quoties,</hi> which it will be hard for him to do; and if he talk of Chriſts ſanctifying a form with his own mouth, he muſt give us either the very words Chriſt ſpoke, or elſe a juſter tranſlation of them than any he will find in the Common-prayer-book.</p>
            <p>Finally, If we have not received the grace of the Goſpel in vain, we muſt look on Chriſt as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from the dead, aſcended into heaven, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Univerſal Prieſt, Interceſſor, and Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; ſo could not the Diſciples look on him when Chriſt taught them to pray; which may be the reaſon why he told them, <hi>that hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name,</hi> Joh. 16.24. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though it be lawful and expedient to uſe the Lords Prayer, as we commonly uſe it; and though the things to be prayed for, cannot be better ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up, or more briefly compriſed; yet vulgar people will be in great danger not to ſay the Lords Prayer in the Lords name; not to think of his merit and interceſſion, unleſs they have prayers ſo formed as to force them to a more diſtinct appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Chriſts propitiation, than the Lords Prayer doth. Let it be obſerved whether the Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies made, or mentioned to be made after Chriſts aſcenſion into heaven, do not lead us diſtinctly and particularly to offer and aſcribe praiſe unto God, in the name of Chriſt, or by Chriſt; or unto God and the Lamb, or unto Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.13. The more pains that Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi> and others do take to ſhow us the Lords Prayer in the Jewiſh Liturgies, the more do they unawares
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105061:55"/>ſtrengthen men in a perſuaſion that it was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be a pattern to us to form our prayers unto, any more than as to the matter, or things to be prayed for. It cannot be that the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Liturgy ſhould not differ much in the manner of our addreſſes unto God: it will be hard to find the Holy One called <hi>the God and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>his God and our God, his father and our father,</hi> by any Jew; and yet no expreſſions more meet for the mouth of a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>I paſs to the third calumny in Mr. <hi>D.</hi>'s p. 144. <hi>Moſt of them wholly neglected the Lords Supper for many years.</hi> Neglect is when a Miniſter hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to adminiſter, and doth not adminiſter; Did moſt of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> thus neglect the adminiſtration of the Euchariſt? Who doth not know that many of them adminiſtred it oftner than by the Liturgy is required? Hath Mr. <hi>D.</hi> never heard of their Aſſociations either printed or not printed, in order to the exerciſe of diſcipline? Doth not the Directory ſay, The Lords Supper is to be adminiſtred often? If any ſecluded any one from that Ordinance who was of an orderly life, and underſtood the firſt principles of the Oracles of God, he did it not from <hi>Presbyterian</hi> principles; but I remember that p. 44. he taxeth the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of this Kingdom, and ſaith, <hi>That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of</hi> Oxford <hi>had no Communion for above twelve years.</hi> Yet the Miniſters are known, who did frequently adminiſter the Communion in the Churches and Chappels of that Univerſity, in thoſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105061:56"/>twelve years. But it may be he meant, <hi>that in twelve years time the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity as an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity had no Communion.</hi> To which I ſay, If that were a fault, it will not much concern the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> for the four Vicechancellors of <hi>Oxford</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe twelve years, were not <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> and perhaps the Univerſity as an Univerſity, is not a Church: for if it be, who is Paſtor of it? or who hath power to cenſure thoſe who be diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly? Both Chancellor and Vicechancellor may be lay-men. The Communions appointed to be at St. <hi>Maries</hi> at the beginning of the Terms, were lately appointed, and the penalties appointed for thoſe who neglect to come to them, are not Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical penalties, and I believe the twentieth part of the Univerſity never was at any one of them: was it meet to make ſuch a clamour about the omiſſion of them?</p>
            <p>A fourth Calumny is, <hi>That in the Presbyterians Congregations, there was a great irreverence at prayer, very few kneeling, many not ſo much as pulling off their hats.</hi> Of this irreverence he ſaith he is an eye-witneſs. Was he not well employed the mean while? Could he find nothing elſe to do when in a Chriſtian Congregation, but only to tell how many kneeled, and who had their hats quite off, and who half off, and who never uncovered their head at all? In how many Congregations was he to make this obſervation? if (as is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) but in a few, what unrighteouſneſs is it to meaſure all Congregations by a few? And is he ſure that the men whom he obſerved to be ſo ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent, were <hi>Presbyterians?</hi> Why might they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105061:56"/>not be ſome of his own perſwaſion who did come to put an affront on <hi>Presbyterians</hi> Prayers? Either kneeling, or ſtanding <hi>Presbyterians</hi> commended to their people, and never practiſed (unleſs in caſe of infirmity) any other geſture in praying that ever I heard of, and yet I have made enquiry. But it was neceſſary that Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſhould draw them like Devils or elſe he could not have made them abhorred.</p>
            <p>Could a man but obtain leave of his conſcience to lay open the irreverence of the Epiſcopal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, what ſtories might he tell? More I am ſure than Mr. <hi>D.</hi> would be willing to hear. I believe there is not an honeſt heart but akes to conſider the rudeneſs of the admirers of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy in their addreſſes to God whether in the Church or in their own houſes. I ſpeak of the vulgar ſort of them; put on their Hats they do not, but they uſually ſit on their ſeats, at publick Prayer, and which is worſe ſtare up and down to ſee who comes in, and who goes out of the Church, if their Landlord chance to come in, in the midſt of their Devotion up they riſe and make their obeiſance. Follow them to their Houſes there you may obſerve them to truſs and pray, to waſh their Faces and to ſay their Prayers. I once met with an old man who had been bred up to Liturgies all his days, dealing with him about his Soul, I found he never prayed any thing at home but the Lords-Prayer, and that he never repeated that Prayer till he was firſt got into his bed, and he told me he thought no man in <hi>England</hi> uſed any other poſture in ſaying his Prayers. And I was
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105061:57"/>told by a Miniſter whom I dare believe, that he hapned at an Inn, to lie in the ſame Chamber with a man of a good eſtate, who waking in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thinking the Divine to be aſleep, gets out of his bed, takes his Doublet and Breeches, falls to dreſſing himſelf, but whileſt he dreſſed himſelf he ſaid the general confeſſion and the abſolution in the Common-Prayer-Book; when he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the Lords-Prayer, then he took the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-pot into his hand, and did it may be imagined what. Here's irreverence with a witneſs, I charge it not on Epiſcopacy, yet I may with a better conſcience than Mr. <hi>D.</hi> chargeth the not putting off of Hats at Prayer on <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Nonconformiſts.</hi> He that would know what outward reverence they require in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and upon what reaſons they build it, and how neceſſary they account it, and what thoughts they have of thoſe who uſe it not, may inform himſelf from Mr. <hi>Arthur Hilderſhams</hi> plain but very ſolid diſcourſe on the fourth of St. <hi>John.</hi> He that hath not the Book by him may find much quoted out of him by Dr. <hi>Nicholat Bernard</hi> in his diſcourſe of a ſet form of Prayer, <hi>Printed,</hi> 1659.</p>
            <p>And now that I am fallen upon Mr. <hi>D</hi>'s forty fourth page, it may not be amiſs to advert that he fears not to ſay, <hi>all the Reformed world over no man that is not a notorious ill-liver, is debarred from the Sacrament;</hi> what will he be afraid to ſay that fears not to ſay this? Is there no reformed Church that debars any but a notorious ill-liver from the Sacrament? Certainly it is not neceſſary
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105061:57"/>that he who danceth ſhould be a notorious ill liver? and yet Mr. <hi>D.</hi> knows where any that can be proved to have danced, would be kept from the Sacrament. He that ſhould turn <hi>Pelagian</hi> may be no notorious ill-liver, yet ſuch a one would be kept from the Sacrament in moſt if not in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, ſo would he alſo that ſhould not be ſatisfied to bring his Child to Baptiſm; and yet I imagine ſuch a one need not be a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ill-liver. Suppoſe an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant ſhould think it irreverence to receive the Sacrament not kneeling, ſuch a man if Mr. <hi>D.</hi> be to be believed cannot be admitted to the Sacrament in <hi>France,</hi> yet ſuch a one may lead a life not notoriouſly ſcandalous. By a Canon of our own Church, the communion is to be adminiſtred to none but ſuch as kneel, nor to any but ſuch as be preſent at publick Prayers, according to the orders of the Church, yet I know ſome ſuch who are far enough from being notorious ill livers. I am almoſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that there is ſcarce a reformed Church whoſe Principles and Rules of diſcipline do not debar ſuch from Sacramental communion as are no noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ill livers, I wiſh I were as certain that no Reformed Churches did contrary to their own Rules of diſcipline, admit ſuch as are notorious ill-livers, then I ſhould promiſe my ſelf that Chriſt would with more delight walk among his golden Candleſticks.</p>

               <hi>P.</hi> 185. Whatever be the reaſon of it, <hi>Our Liturgy hath no other Enemies abroad where it is well known, but the Papiſts.</hi> This is an untruth as might be proved, by a thouſand inſtances. But
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105061:58"/>let us ſee the occaſion of it, that we have in the ſame Page. <hi>The Magiſtrate of</hi> Paris <hi>his ſtopping the Printing and forbidding the publiſhing of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Liturgy,</hi> (<hi>whereas that of</hi> Geneva <hi>is dayly Printed and ſold there</hi>) the reaſon he thinks could be no other, but a fear that it would be better liked by moſt Chriſtians, <hi>that have either judgment, learning or true piety, and are void of ſuperſtition, peeviſhneſs, extravagant zeal, and prophaneneſs, be they of what perſwaſion ſoever.</hi> This is not very charitable, all or moſt that are not either ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, peeviſh, extravagantly zealous, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane will better like the <hi>Engliſh</hi> than the <hi>Geneva</hi> Liturgy. If after this the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters do not Petition their King that they may exchange the <hi>Geneva</hi> for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgy, they know their doom.</p>
            <p>Perhaps Mr. <hi>D.</hi> will plead that the <hi>French</hi> living in <hi>France,</hi> would be denied the uſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgy Tranſlated into their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage though they ſhould deſire it. But what will he ſay to thoſe <hi>French</hi> Churches that are ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered up and down in this Nation, they are not ſure quite void of judgment, learning, true piety, yet it is known, that they when they might have had thanks from Archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> if they would have received the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgy for the <hi>French,</hi> which they had been accuſtomed to, did not care for receiving of it, but uſed all poſſible endeavours to keep themſelves in <hi>ſtatu quo.</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> relates the Hiſtory of their wreſtlings againſt the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of our Liturgy among them, from him Mr. <hi>D.</hi> may take it at his leiſure. If I have not
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105061:58"/>forgot ſince I read it, one argument made uſe of to keep the Metropolitan from preſſing them to Conformity, was drawn from the juſt fear there was, that by ſo rigorous calling for Uniformity, the Chriſtian King might be moved to perſecute his Proteſtant Subjects; for Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> had given out ſuch a ſpeech, <hi>If the King of</hi> England <hi>being a Proteſtant will not ſuffer two diſciplines, why ſhould the King of</hi> France <hi>being a Papiſt ſuffer two Religions?</hi> A ſhrewd ſpeech and well to be thought on by any Metropolitan that ſhall go about to bring all foreign Churches to comply with our own, or elſe to diſſolve them.</p>
            <p>I take no notice of the High commendations given of our Liturgy, by the noble Princeſs of <hi>Turenne,</hi> and the Dutcheſs of <hi>la Force</hi> her own Mother, he that will may ſee them <hi>Page</hi> 78, and 186. I only wiſh that if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgy be of ſo great force to edifie people in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, it had been put into the hand of the Noble Marqueſs of <hi>Turenne</hi> to prevent his revolt to <hi>Popery,</hi> for it is ſaid that he is grown a Roman Catholick.</p>
            <p>In his Sermon <hi>P.</hi> 20. He is not aſhamed to ſay <q>that whoſoever hath devotion and leiſure enough to come to the Church, and be preſent at Divine Service every day morning and evening may hear the whole Bible read every Year, the old Teſtament once, and the new no leſs than thrice, and the Book of Pſalms no leſs than twelve times.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This can only be practiſed by thoſe who live near to Cathedrals, let us imagine that any ſo
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105061:59"/>living, had devotion, and leiſure enough, to come to his mother Church, from the firſt of <hi>January,</hi> to the laſt of <hi>December,</hi> this man would not hear the whole Bible, neither the Old Teſtament once, nor the New Teſtament thrice. The Liturgy ſaith ſo, yet Mr. <hi>D.</hi> in a pang of zeal, dare ſay otherwiſe. Whether the Church do well to leave out 188 Chapters of the Old Teſtament, and to appoint 121 of the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> is not the queſtion, we are on a matter of fact, and I ſay Mr. <hi>D.</hi> hath falſified in that, and will have no thanks for his falſification, the Church not deſiring him to lie for her ſake.</p>
            <p>Another tale in <hi>P.</hi> 23. of his Sermon. <hi>It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the People that they repeat aloud the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Sins, that they may be more ſenſibly affected therewith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is juſt like giving a reaſon why the Swan ſings juſt before her death whenas we know that ſhe doth not ſo ſing. The people are not required to repeat aloud the confeſſion of ſins, rather they are exhorted to repeat it with a ſubmiſs, or lowly voice. But now we are fallen on this word <hi>Loud,</hi> I would fain know what the meaning of it is. In the firſt Book of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth the Prieſt being in the Quire was appointed to begin the Divine Service with the Lords-Prayer, uſing a loud voice; in the late Liturgies he is appointed after the Abſolution, to begin it with a loud voice; in this laſt with an audible voice, the people kneeling and repeating it with him; in the <hi>Precatiuncles</hi> after the Creed, the Miniſter, Clarks, and People are ordered to ſay the Lords-Prayer with a loud
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105061:59"/>voice, in former and later Books. But in K. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s firſt Book the people were not to ſpeak till <hi>deliver us from evil;</hi> at evening prayer t's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that the Miniſter ſhall kneel, <hi>and ſay the Lords-Prayer, the people kneeling, and repeating it with him,</hi> no mention being made of the kind of voice to be uſed, yet after the Creed at evening prayer, all are to ſay the Prayer with a loud voice. I never obſerved any Miniſter or people to ſpeak louder, in repeating the Lords Prayer at one time than at another, nor know I what is meant by a loud voice, or whether there be any difference betwixt it and an audible voice, nor if there be none, what's meant by an audible voice, for to whom muſt the peoples voice be audible, to thoſe that ſit next to them? or to the Miniſter? or to the whole congregation? Mr. <hi>D.</hi> doth converſe with great perſonages, and he knows the meaning of theſe terms.</p>
            <p>
               <q>P. 265. In the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the making of the Act of Uniformity, thoſe that did not love white, made a great noiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without this land, and beſtirred themſelves on all ſides that they might be diſpenſed with for wearing the ſurplice. Among other means uſed by them to come to their ends, they applied themſelves to ſome in the reformed Churches beyond the Seas, and perſwaded them that if the ſurplice was impoſed, huge numbers of Miniſters, nay many of the Biſhops themſelves, would leave their Miniſtry. Whereupon the Prince Elector Palatine that then was, commanded <hi>Zanchius</hi> to write to the Queen, to diſſwade her Majeſty
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105061:60"/>from impoſing the uſe of ſuch Veſtments, which he did accordingly; but the buſineſs not ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to their deſires, and the Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts giving out ſtill that there would be a great diſſipation in this Church by the deſertion of ſo many Biſhops and Miniſters, what did <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> thereupon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Such an Harangue of impertinence and falſhood have I ſeldom or never met with; and yet we are in the Margin directed to <hi>Zanchy</hi>'s Epiſtle to <hi>Juel,</hi> as if thence all the materials of it had been fetched. In my books <hi>Zanchy</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Juel</hi> bears date juſt the very day next to that written to Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> ſo that in twenty four hours time the Nonconformiſts of <hi>England</hi> muſt know that a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came from <hi>heidelberg</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> was received by the Queen, and proved not effectual with her, and thereupon give out ſtories of Biſhops that would leave their Sees, and hope for another Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to be made on their behalf; if ſo, they muſt needs have the Intelligences that move the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum mobile</hi> for their Secretaries and Meſſengers. <hi>Zanchy</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Juel</hi> I am ſure doth not in the leaſt intimate, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nonconformiſts made any applications to ſome in the Reformed Churches beyond the Seas; all that can thence be collected, is but this, that the <hi>June</hi> before he did write his Letter, <hi>one called</hi> Montius <hi>returned out of</hi> England, <hi>and told him beſides others, that a great difference was ſtirred up in the Engliſh Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Veſtments, and therefore deſired him that he would by a Letter both admoniſh the Queen of her Office, and alſo write to thoſe Biſhops that were
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:105061:60"/>known to him, and eſpecially to</hi> Juel. Upon his and others entreaties, and his Princes command, <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> did write to the Queen a Letter, as he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, not evil, (which is to be ſeen) and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the Queen would do, he writes alſo to <hi>Juel,</hi> That he would by his Authority, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Prudence, endeavour with the Biſhops not to leave their Sees, rather than wear linnen; yet ſo, that they muſt know that the Queen is inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and alſo when they wear linne, make a proteſtation.</p>
            <p>This Letter, 'tis like, never came to <hi>Juel</hi>'s hands, he dying about twelve days after it was written. Nor need it trouble us, that <hi>Juel</hi> never ſaw it, ſeeing there was no Biſhop then in any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to loſe his Place for not wearing linnen; nor can I think there is any one Miniſter now ſo much out of love with white, as rather to leave his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, than put on a Surplice, provided he may but make lawful proteſtation how and on what accounts he uſeth it. Indeed the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of ſome Nonconformiſts in the late times was this, that they loved white too well; for their woollen clothes were white, or next to white; their locks were powdered with white powder, their white Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhirts were very viſible, to the great offence of ſome ſerious perſons both in Countrey and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. But let not Mr. <hi>D.</hi> rejoice becauſe ſome Nonconformiſts did thus habit themſelves; for theſe Nonconformiſts were not <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> but either inclined to ways of ſeparation, or elſe ſuch as had new<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y laid by their Canonical dreſs, and were reſolved no longer to be called black-coats.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105061:61"/>Here therefore let me beſeech all who would not be deceived in reading our Hiſtories concerning the diſorderly carriages of Miniſters in the late times, well to conſider who they were that were ſo diſorderly; and if they find that any of them were of the old Nonconforming <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> I am much miſtaken: if they find none were ſuch, how unreaſonable is it to charge on <hi>Presbyterians</hi> the faults of ſuch as returned to Conformity ſo ſoon as His Majeſty required them; and left not off to conform till they could not keep their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and Livings too?</p>
            <p>Too too long I have been in detecting falſhoods, had it not been neceſſary to try whether I could put Mr. <hi>D.</hi> to ſome ſhame. I am now to ſhew you, as briefly as I can, in how many things he hath wronged his Munificent and Bountiful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 10. He takes pains to tell us of an Oath of Canonical obedience ſworn by Miniſters in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> to the Biſhop and to the Seniors: in the Oath he that ſwears, acknowledgeth himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Miniſtry from both Biſhop and Seniors. Theſe Seniors are but a more eminent ſort of <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> as his quotation <hi>p.</hi> 11. intimates. What is this but to bring in <hi>Hungary</hi>'s witneſs againſt the ſole power of Order and Juriſdiction of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Biſhops?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 12, 13. He relates a tedious ſtory of the <hi>fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres Bohemi,</hi> and <hi>the care that they took to preſerve a ſucceſſion of Miniſters. They ſent</hi> Michael Zam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergius <hi>and two more to the poor</hi> Waldenſes (who never had a Biſhop among them but in title only)
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105061:61"/>
               <hi>and two titular Biſhops, with ſome that had not ſo much as the title of Biſhops, made</hi> Zambergius <hi>and his two Collegues Biſhops, giving them power of Ordination.</hi> This is manifeſtly to put a weapon into the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> hands; they were wont only to quote the ſtory of <hi>Pelagius</hi> the Pope being ordained by a <hi>Presbyter</hi> with two Biſhops, now Mr. <hi>D.</hi> hath afforded them another Story, to prove that a <hi>Presbyter</hi> may lay hands on, and ordain Biſhops; Is this his kindneſs to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates?</p>
            <p>Another prejudice and miſchief he deſignes to the Church is as he tells us, <hi>Page</hi> 14. <hi>To ſet forth a Collection of the ſeveral Liturgies of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches.</hi> This may pleaſe him, becauſe it is the brat of his own brain, but will not ſure pleaſe the Reverend Fathers of the Church. Doth he not know that Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> did put a ſtop to the Letters Patents, for a Collection for the Palatinate, becauſe it was ſaid in them, <hi>that the Palatinate Religion, and ours was the ſame, and that Popery was an Antichriſtian yoke?</hi> Doth he not alſo know that when a Book was Publiſhed here in <hi>England</hi> intituled <hi>a Declaration of the Faith and Ceremonies of the Palſgraves Churches,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> took a courſe to call it in? I adviſe him, if he love his preferments, no more to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in this kind. Had Dr. <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi> any thing beſtowed on him ſince he anſwered <hi>Philanax Anglicus?</hi>

               <hi>P.</hi> 45. He quotes <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaying <hi>that the cuſtom of diſtributing the Sacrament but thrice a year is vitious,</hi> and yet that is the cuſtom of our Church,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105061:62"/>and that not obſerved in all places neither, for the generality communicate but once a year, and ſo follow, if Mr. <hi>D.</hi> be in the right, <hi>the Devils invention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 53. He ſaith by juſt and evident conſequence that there is not a wiſe underſtanding Chriſtian in our Church, for theſe are his words: <hi>That every national Church ought to have <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity within it ſelf, hath always been the judgment of all ſober Chriſtians:</hi> I aſſume, <hi>That every national Church ſhould have <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity within it ſelf, hath not been the judgment of the Church of</hi> England. I tremble for Mr. <hi>D</hi>'s ſake to infer the concluſion. The Minor I prove from the Canons of 1640. where a difformity is allowed, and the Apoſtolical rule commended to diſſenters, not to judge, not to deſpiſe.</p>
            <p>Follow him but to <hi>P.</hi> 93 and there you ſhall have him charging Rebellion and Schiſme on the major part of his Conforming brethren. For there he tells us <hi>of a great perſecution againſt all Miniſters who adhered to the King and Church of</hi> England <hi>during the late troubles, this perſecution was ſo gentle to ſome as only to plunder and turn them out of their livings, but caſt others out of the Land, or forced them to a voluntary exile.</hi> Thus therefore I argue:</p>
            <q>
               <p>All Miniſters that adhered to the King and Church, were either turned out of their livings or baniſhed, or left the Land.</p>
               <p>The major part of the Conforming Miniſters did neither loſe their livings, nor were baniſhed, nor went into voluntary exile.</p>

                  </gap>re the major part of the Conforming Miniſters neither adhered to King, nor Church, and by juſt conſequence were Traitors and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Minor is as clear as the Sun, to all that obſerved the management of things in <hi>England,</hi> he that Licenſed Mr. <hi>D</hi>'s Book had <hi>the ſame Fellowſhip in All Soules,</hi> at his Majeſties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that he had at the decollation of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 95. He tells us, <hi>that he and ſome others were admitted to livings in</hi> France, <hi>the Synod deſiring them only to conform to their Rites, Ceremonies, and Orders, for the time they ſhould live amongſt them, (for a Nonconformiſt Miniſter is a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and never ſuffered in thoſe Churches.)</hi> This is nonſenſe to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> ear, for the Church may be full of <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> if men are admitted into livings, being deſired only and not enjoyned to conform to Rites and Ceremonies and Orders. But he told us <hi>P.</hi> 54. <hi>All admitted to livings muſt ſubſcribe to the confeſſion of faith,</hi> wherefore we may think he ſubſcribed to the parity of Miniſters, and by an order paſſed at <hi>Charenton</hi> all are to ſwear they will propugne the Canons of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> if that order be not reſcinded, then 'tis like he is under Oath to defend a Doctrine which moſt of the Fathers of this Church think, if not againſt our own Doctrine, yet ſubverſive of the Doctrine according to Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 96. He ſaith that it is a principle common to all reformed Churches in the World, <hi>That every national Church hath power to make Laws for her ſelf, in all ſuch outward things as are not either
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105061:63"/>expreſly commanded, or forbidden in the word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God forbid that any ſuch principle ſhould be maintained, by all or by any Reformed Church in the whole world. There are many outward as well as inward things not commanded nor forbidden expreſly, but only by juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence, about which the Church hath no power to make Laws to her ſelf any more than about thoſe things that are expreſly either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or forbidden, elſe there would be mad work in the World. Where doth Mr. <hi>D.</hi> find family Prayer, or infant Baptiſme, or the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lords days expreſly either forbidden or commanded in Gods word? He will ſay that the Church may make Laws about theſe, I grant ſhe may, but no other than what ſhe can make about things either commanded or forbidden expreſly. So that he wrongeth not only our own Church, but all Reformed Churches in affixing ſuch a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to them. Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> aſcribes to <hi>Calvin</hi> a quite contrary principle. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> of <hi>Presb.</hi> 238. <q>That in carrying on the work of a Reformation, there is not any thing to be exacted, which is not warranted, and required by the word of God; that in ſuch caſes there is no Rule left for worldly wiſdom, for moderation and compliance, but all things to be ordered, as they are directed by his will revealed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 241. He makes this <hi>Calvins</hi> rule, and <hi>Martyrs</hi> judgment to be grounded on it, <hi>That nothing ſhould be acted in a Reformation, which is not warranted expreſly in the word of God.</hi> Are
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105061:63"/>Eaſt and Weſt more oppoſite than Dr. <hi>H.</hi> and Mr. <hi>D.</hi> yet neither truly repreſents the opinion of the Reformed. I beſeech thoſe who are at leiſure, and have well ſtudied the point, to ſtate plainly and clearly unto us the due matter of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Laws, and to ſhow us the meaning of the term, indifferent, ſo frequently made uſe of in this Controverſy: for it ſeemeth ſomewhat an uncouth aſſertion that Church governors may command all things that are uſually called indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, for then many of their Laws would be very contemptible. The old definition of things <hi>Adiaphorous</hi> was, that they were things neither commanded, nor forbidden; this definition ſeemed to me innocent enough, but of late there are Divines ſprung up, that ſay, the higheſt acts of love to God are not commanded, neither I trow are they forbidden, muſt we call them then things indifferent? And hath the Church power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine who ſhall put forth thoſe Acts, and how often they ſhall be put forth? It may be Mr. <hi>D.</hi> thinks the higheſt acts of love are commanded, (and ſo do I) but he had beſt not to be too forward in publiſhing that notion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 99. He falls into an high commendation of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Churches, as he doth alſo in many other Pages of his Book; this is little to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of our Church; for if that Church be to be imitated, we muſt have lay <hi>Presbyters</hi> and lay <hi>Presbytereſſes</hi> alſo, Paſtors of Pariſhes muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, people muſt come under examination every time they receive the Sacrament, we muſt have no dancings, and we may have particular Synods
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105061:64"/>without a Biſhop, if we communicate the acts thereof preſently to the abſent Biſhops, and we muſt have none brought into Communion but thoſe who are willing, and yet we here can by cenſures, if we pleaſe, make Papiſts communicate with us, or elſe have them excommunicated and clapt into Priſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 107. He gives the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> lame Cauſe a cruth. For he ſaith, <hi>God only hath power to bind the Conſcience immediately;</hi> ask him when mens Conſciences are bound immediately, he tells you, <hi>when humane Laws and Conſtitutions are thruſt upon men, as if they were Divine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here will the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> ſay, Epiſcopacy which is but an humane inſtitution, is thruſt on us as Divine, and not only as good and profitable; therefore unleſs we will give men juriſdiction over our conſciences, we cannot conform. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> cannot bring himſelf off here, but by maintaining that Epiſcopacy is a Divine inſtitution, and it would be too great impudence to ſay that in ſo ſaying he ſhould not contradict every reformed Church almoſt beſides our own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 118. He mentions the ſending of a Printed Copy of the Acts of the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> to King <hi>James,</hi> Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by <hi>Feſtus Hommius,</hi> this is to rub a ſore place, and to tell the World, that we who now ſuffer our Divines and Students to beſpatter that Synod, did once well approve of its deciſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 126. He mentions a Letter of Monſieur <hi>le Moine,</hi> out of which he ſaith he will ſet down <hi>as much as fits his preſent deſign:</hi> what doth he ſet

That the <hi>Engliſh have a natural fierceneſs, and withal a natural inclination to ſuperſtition.</hi> Is this for Mr. <hi>Durells</hi> deſign, to blaft the people of that nation where he hath been ſo highly preferred? Are we indeed fierce and ſuperſtitious? Naturally fierce, and naturally Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious? What kind of ſuperſtition is it to which we are ſo naturally inclined, that ſo we may know how to enquire after the cure of ſo dangerous a diſeaſe? It is no matter if we may believe Mr. <hi>Moine</hi> to enquire further, let but Epiſcopal Authority be eſtabliſhed, that will keep us from going beyond our bounds. Very good, but by whom ſhall this Epiſcopal Authority be managed? By <hi>Engliſh</hi> men I hope, but how then can we be aſſured that their natural fierceneſs and inclination to ſuperſtition will not remain in them? We never could obſerve that a mans being conſtituted a Biſhop did make him leſs fierce or ſuperſtitious, any more than leſs an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man. Perhaps this Learned Predicant would have all our Divines come and ſtudy in <hi>France,</hi> that they may loſe their diſeaſe of ſuperſtition, as ſometimes they do their Conſumptions in ſo refined an Air, but that Plot will not take. He hath another argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Epiſcopacy, <hi>it cannot enter into a rational mans imagination, that a great Kingdom ſhould come by cuſtom to be content to ſee its Biſhops no more, having honoured and reverenced them for the ſpace of</hi> 1400 <hi>Years.</hi> If this be ſo, then may the Biſhops be ſecure, we are ſo accuſtomed to love them, that we cannot be content to be without them, and have been a great Kingdom and honoured and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105061:65"/>reverenced them 1400 Years. Where may we that live in <hi>England</hi> find theſe things recorded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our ſelves? for the Hiſtories we read uſually, do not make us a great Kingdom, but many petty Kingdoms 1400 Years ago.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If ever any made their ungratefulneſs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, certainly they are the <hi>Engliſh</hi> oppoſers of Epiſcopacy, who will not conſider that they owe their Reformation to the care and zeal of their Biſhops, who did ſo wonderfully well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purge the Church of <hi>England</hi> an hundred years ago, and ſo happily ſet up the holy truth again, in its genuine luſtre. But this is not all they owe unto them: they owe them alſo their Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. For whether it was brought over into <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> or by <hi>Simon Cannaeus,</hi> or by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or by <hi>Luke</hi> diſciple of <hi>Philip,</hi> or by <hi>Phaganus</hi> and <hi>Peruſianus,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> it is conſtant that it was done by the Miniſtry of Biſhops, and that they are endebted to their charity, zeal, and abilities, for the holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation they now enjoy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Do we indeed owe our late Reformation from Popery unto Biſhops? <hi>Wickliff</hi> the day-ſtar of our reformation, was no Biſhop; thoſe that ſuffered in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths time were no Biſhops: <hi>Cranmer</hi> when he firſt ſet himſelf to diſpute againſt the Marriage was no Biſhop, when under that King he obtained to be a Biſhop he had his hand in the blood of the Saints. Yet we honour his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, for what he did towards Reformation in King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth's time, and for what he had
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105061:65"/>begun to do in his fathers reign, we can eaſily forgive him his Petitioning the King for liberty for his ſiſter <hi>Mary,</hi> and his fierce oppoſition to Mr. <hi>Hooper;</hi> but we ſhould be againſt the truth, if we do not ſay, that our Reformation had been very imperfect, if not ſtrenuouſly promoted by the <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> of that age. We muſt need ſay, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> did recant, and that Biſhop <hi>Ridly</hi> had begun in the Tower to go to Maſs, and left not off, till reclaimed by the Letter of his Nonconforming friend and Pupil Mr. <hi>John Bradford.</hi> Thoſe that leaſt loved ceremonies did leaſt love their lives when they were to loſe them for Chriſts ſake. I take no pleaſure in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, nor had I made it, but that Mr. <hi>D.</hi> aſcribes <hi>a ſtrange weakneſs to Mr.</hi> Hooper, <hi>and makes</hi> Peter Martyr <hi>to ſcruple a Cap becauſe it was too Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical.</hi> As for our firſt converſion from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſme, Mr. <hi>Moine</hi> writes very ſtrangely about it.</p>
            <p>P. 40. Elſe he would not ſaint <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and not <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> nor <hi>Philip,</hi> nor <hi>Simon Cannaeus.</hi> Nor ſecondly would he have left out <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> whom ſome have affirmed to Preach the Goſpel among us, and to be Biſhop of <hi>Britan,</hi> and to have ended his days in <hi>Britan,</hi> and inſtead of him put in <hi>Luke</hi> a diſciple of <hi>Philip:</hi> for what conſiderable Author ever aſcribed the firſt bringing of Chriſtianity among us unto <hi>Luke</hi> a diſciple of <hi>Philip?</hi> We have indeed a ſtory that St. <hi>Philip,</hi> (but whether the Apoſtle or Evangeliſt none can tell) ſent over twelve Preachers into <hi>Britan</hi> perhaps Mr. <hi>Moine</hi> hath met with ſome Autho,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105061:66"/>who tells him that one of their names was <hi>Luke,</hi> but the chief of them being <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> as all agree, unto him we muſt aſcribe the work under God.</p>
            <p>But he will ſcarce be proved to be a Biſhop, or to have left any Biſhop behind him. It may be in the reign of King <hi>Lucius</hi> we ſhall meet with Biſhops. The ſtory of him runs thus; That about the year 160 he began to have a good liking of Chriſtianity, being convinced by the Miracles he ſaw or heard to be wrought by the Chriſtians of that age. He had with him, <hi>Elvanus,</hi> and <hi>Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinus</hi> two holy men, and well verſed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whom he ſends to <hi>Eleutherius</hi> (or as ſome would have his name written <hi>Eleutherus</hi>) Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> deſiring that by him he might be made a Chriſtian, that is Chriſtned or Baptized, for he is conceived to have believed with the heart before. Why did he ſend ſo far to procure Baptiſme? had he no Miniſters in that <hi>Iſland</hi> over a part of which he was an under King? Perhaps he had, but thought it more Royal to ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> for Miniſters; from <hi>Rome</hi> he had two ſent him, the Roman Martyrology calls them <hi>Fugatius,</hi> and <hi>Donatianus,</hi> alias <hi>Damianus,</hi> others write them <hi>Faganus</hi> and <hi>Derwianus</hi> or <hi>Dunianus,</hi> others <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganus</hi> and <hi>Duvianus,</hi> (none I think <hi>Phaganus</hi> and <hi>Peruſianus</hi> but M. <hi>M.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi>) That either of theſe was a Biſhop there is no evidence, <hi>Maſon</hi> ſaith plainly, neither of them did ever attain that dignity. <hi>Elvanus</hi> ſome ſay was made a Biſhop, and <hi>Medvinus</hi> a Doctor or Presbyter. Hitherto we have but a Biſhop, no Biſhops, to whoſe zeal
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105061:66"/>we are endebted for our Chriſtianity. And I am of opinion that as <hi>Elvanus</hi> was as much a Doctor as <hi>Medvinus,</hi> ſo <hi>Medvinus</hi> was as much a Biſhop as <hi>Elvanus,</hi> and that there never was Biſhop pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called among us till <hi>Auſtin</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi> was ſent hither from <hi>Rome.</hi> The ſtories of 28 Biſhops made in the room of 28 <hi>Flamens,</hi> and 3 Archbiſhops made in the place of 3 <hi>Archflamens,</hi> ſeems to me as well as to Mr. <hi>Fuller, Flammes,</hi> and <hi>Archflammes.</hi> I know that at the Council of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum, Sulpitius</hi> makes three Biſhops out of <hi>Britan,</hi> to be preſent, <hi>Anno</hi> 259. As alſo that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhops at the Council of <hi>Sardis, Anno</hi> 347. Nor will I deny that <hi>Reſtitutus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> is reported to have ſubſcribed to the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> Anno 314: but if he and others ſubſcribed to the determinations of that Synod, how comes it to paſs that the Churches to which they belonged did not account themſelves concerned to leave off their old, and almoſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular way of obſerving Eaſter? ſurely it muſt be becauſe Biſhops were not then thought to have ſo much authority over their Churches as now they would be thought to have. When <hi>Auſtin</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi> had got entertainment in the Kingdom of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and was made Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> he calls a Council to be made up of <hi>Britiſh,</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> and now if ever, we ſhall find what the Government Eccleſiaſtical of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> was, and pity it is we muſt fetch our account of it, only, or principally, from <hi>Bede,</hi> a venerable man indeed, but a Saxon, and profeſſed enemy to the <hi>Britiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:105061:67"/>
            <p>Two Meetings <hi>Auſtin</hi> and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> had: To the firſt came certain Biſhops, ſaith <hi>Bede,</hi> lib. 2. c. 2. but let his phraſe be obſerved, <hi>Epiſcopi, ſive Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctores</hi> being come, <hi>Auſtin</hi> layeth to their charge, That they practiſed many things contrary to the unity of the Church. But they continuing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their own rites to thoſe that <hi>Auſtin</hi> would have commended to them, the crafty Archbiſhop per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them to refer the deciſion to God himſelf, but ſo that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> who were in poſſeſſion, muſt firſt try whether God would work a miracle in favour of their opinion; not being able to cure a blind man brought before them. <hi>Auſtin</hi> falls on his knees, praying the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that by reſtoring ſight to that one blind man, he would enlighten the eyes of many; and forthwith the blind was enabled to ſee. What was the effect? the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ought to have condemned themſelves for conſenting to tempt God; but if we may believe <hi>Bede,</hi> they acknowledge that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> declared the way of righteouſneſs (as if the way of righteouſneſs had conſiſted in rites and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies); <hi>but that they could not without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and leave of theirs, depart from their old cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms.</hi> It ſeems theſe Biſhops did not think that their conſent could conclude their Presbyters and people. Well, another meeting is agreed on, to which came no fewer than ſeven Biſhops and many very learned men, eſpecially out of the famous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtry now called <hi>Bangor,</hi> but anciently <hi>Bancorna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh;</hi> theſe, before they came to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, ask counſel of a wiſe and pious <hi>Anchoret,</hi> whether they had beſt deſert their Traditions upon
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105061:67"/>the preaching of <hi>Auſtin: If he be a man of God,</hi> quoth this Counceller, <hi>then follow him; and if when you come into the room, he riſe up to you then take him to be a ſervant of Chriſt. Auſtin</hi> not riſing up to them when they came into the place of confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they contradict him in every thing he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. In three things at laſt, ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> if you will comply, I will bear with all other your diverſities; 1. You muſt celèbrate <hi>Eaſter</hi> as we do. 2. You muſt adminiſter Baptiſm according to the manner of the holy <hi>Roman</hi> Church. 3. You muſt preach with us the Goſpel to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. Of the many other things in which the <hi>Britans</hi> differed from the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> I conceive this was one, that they left both <hi>Ordination and Excommunication to a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter as well as to a Biſhop.</hi> And this <hi>Auſtin</hi> would have tolerated. The reaſons of this my opinion are many, and probable, grounded on the Hiſtories of thoſe times; one I ſhall mention, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Scots</hi> were mingled with the <hi>Britiſh</hi> when they had theſe meetings; now that the <hi>Scots</hi> did originally commit acts of order and juriſdiction to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is a thing well known; if any doubt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, he may receive ſatisfaction from the large Preface of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> to the Hiſtories publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> not twenty years ago. I am the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in this my opinion, becauſe I find that when our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches had throughly imbibed the <hi>Romiſh</hi> modes and cuſtoms, then at a Synod held at <hi>Celichyth A. D.</hi> 816. it was decreed, <hi>That none of the Scottiſh Nation ſhould be permitted to uſe the ſacred Miniſtry among us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was all I had intended about our old <hi>Britiſh</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:105061:68"/>Churches when loe there came to my hands the Hiſtory of Mr. <hi>Petry</hi> quoted by the Latin Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſt; that Hiſtorian goeth a little more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to work, than I have done; for thus ſaith he, <hi>Century</hi> 11. <hi>Pag.</hi> 282, 283.</p>
            <p>
               <q>As for <hi>England</hi> ſince the <hi>Saxons,</hi> or <hi>Engliſhes</hi> receiving the faith by <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> they had always Biſhops; for they had their Pattern from <hi>Rome</hi> as it was then: but if we look up to the Ancient <hi>Britans</hi> in that Land, we ſhall find it otherways. I have ſaid in <hi>Century</hi> 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. that ſeven Biſhops and one Archbiſhop, came from the <hi>Britans</hi> unto <hi>Auguſtin:</hi> and there I followed the words of Biſhop <hi>Juel,</hi> in the defence of the Apology, <hi>Page</hi> 14. <hi>An.</hi> 1520. where he quoteth <hi>Bede, Hiſ. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. and in the ſame <hi>Page</hi> he quoteth <hi>Galfred, lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. repeating the ſame words. What I wrote then upon truſt, I have afterwards examined: and I find that <hi>Bede</hi> ſpeaks not ſo: for in the Edition in <hi>Fol. Camb. An.</hi> 1643. he ſaith, <hi>Auſtin</hi> called the Biſhops or Doctors of the neareſt Province of the <hi>Britans;</hi> and in the ſame <hi>Page,</hi> he, ſpeaking of the ſame perſons, ſaith, a blind <hi>Engliſh</hi> Boy was brought unto the Prieſts of the <hi>Britans,</hi> and again they ſaid they would not depart from the Ancient Cuſtoms, without the conſent and licence, <hi>ſuorum.</hi> In the Margin it is ſaid, in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Language it is ſaid, without the permiſſion, and licence of their Nation. Then ſpeaking of their ſecond conference, he ſaith, then came ſeven Biſhops as they ſaid, and more very Learned men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of that Famous <hi>Monaſtry,</hi> of which the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:105061:68"/>Governour at that time was <hi>Dinooth.</hi> In a word, <hi>Beda</hi> hath not one word of an Archbiſhop; nor in all his Hiſtory nameth he one Biſhops-See, nor any Biſhops name: and whom he calleth Biſhops of <hi>Britan,</hi> he calleth them Doctors, or Teachers, and Prieſts, yea he calleth them oftner Prieſts; nor calleth he them ſimply Biſhops, as he calleth them ſimply Prieſts, but Biſhops, as they ſay, or Biſhops, or Teachers. Yet <hi>Beda</hi> could diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between a Biſhop and a Prieſt—What can be concluded from hence, but that no Biſhop or Prelate was among the <hi>Britans</hi> other than Prieſts? As for <hi>Galfrid,</hi> it is no marvail that he wrote according to the ſtile of his own time, that is the year 1150. The ſaid Author alſo quotes <hi>Gildas</hi> a <hi>Britan Presbyter</hi> diſtinguiſhing Church-men into Biſhops or Prieſts, and the Clerks, but naming no other degree of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, calling the firſt ſort ofteſt <hi>Sacerdotes</hi> ſimply, but never <hi>Epiſcopos,</hi> unleſs he adds <hi>ſive Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>What think I of all this? truly whatever I think, I will not ſay very much, for I have not by me either <hi>Juels</hi> Apology, or the <hi>Cambridg</hi> Edition of <hi>Bede,</hi> or <hi>Galfrid,</hi> or <hi>Gildas.</hi> Only thus much I may ſay, that if <hi>Gildas</hi> who lived before <hi>Auſtin</hi> was ſent to us, and <hi>Bede</hi> who was born as <hi>Thomas Stubbes</hi> computes but <hi>Anno</hi> 677. can give us no tidings of any Church Officers above <hi>Presbyters</hi> among the <hi>Britans,</hi> it will not ſignifie much that <hi>Jeffry Monmouth</hi> who lived but in King <hi>Stephens</hi> time makes mention of Biſhops. To put an end to this matter.</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:105061:69"/>
            <p n="1">1. He who firſt converted this <hi>Iſland</hi> to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity was no Biſhop.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe two whom <hi>Eleutherius</hi> ſent (upon the Petition of <hi>Lucius</hi>) to inſtruct us, were no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf and his aſſociates when they firſt attempted the converſion of the <hi>Mercian Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> were no Biſhops but only Monks.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Wickliffe</hi> and his followers were no Biſhops, but being Presbyters were wont to ordain Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</p>
            <p n="5">5. No one Biſhop ever ſuffered death in <hi>England</hi> for ſtriving againſt <hi>Popery</hi> till Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Reign.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Of thoſe Biſhops who ſuffered in Queen <hi>Maries Reign</hi> the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> may lay claim to as many at leaſt as the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> can do, and perhaps there was not one <hi>Martyr</hi> in all her Reign that afferted the <hi>Jus divinum</hi> of Epiſcopacy. Now if all theſe things be true, what means the clamor of ingratitude againſt <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> for not own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe to whom they owe the Nations Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from Popery yea and its Chriſtianity alſo? But let us view more of Mr. <hi>Moines</hi> Letter. <hi>Pag.</hi> 139. <hi>If the French had kept Biſhops, and as many Ceremonies as would ſerve to fix the attention of the people without ſuperſtition, they ſhould have ſeen for certain, far greater progreſs of Reformation, and the reſiſtance of a great many perſons overcome who are frighted from their communion by the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of their government and the bareneſs of their ſervice.</hi> If this were certain I could wiſh that they had Biſhops and Ceremonies among them
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105061:69"/>to morrow, but we in <hi>England</hi> have not been able to obſerve that the number of Papiſts is leſſened ſince the reſtitution of Biſhops and Ceremonies, nay ſince that ſome among us have fallen off to Popery who before profeſſed the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It is not any form of Government, or external mode of worſhip, that muſt put the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts to ſhame, but the exemplary lives of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and people who ſeparate from them. When men once feel in their hearts the power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, they are in no great danger to turn Roman Catholicks. He hath another conceit, <hi>P.</hi> 139, 140. <hi>that the not receiving of Epiſcopal Government, may hinder the much deſired union with the brethren that do follow the confeſſion of Auſpurg.</hi> In this I do vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently diſſent from him, for the yielding to Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal government would rather alienate them from us. Tell them that the ordinations made by <hi>Luther</hi> are invalid becauſe he was but a mere Presbyter, or that as many of them as come over hither, muſt be reordained before they are capable of any Eccleſiaſtical preferment, unleſs they have been ordained by Biſhops properly ſo called, they will quickly let you ſee that no reconciliation is to be hoped for. I dare boldly ſay the generality of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>England</hi> are againſt no Epiſcopacy but what the <hi>Lutherans</hi> themſelves abhor.</p>
            <p>There are ſundry other things in Mr. <hi>Moines</hi> Letter for the which I could expoſe him, but I forbear, and deſire <hi>Engliſh</hi> men not to eſtimate him by this Letter, which is ſo interpolated that he need not own it as his. I undertake at any time to bring a credible witneſs, that ſhall ſwear, <hi>that</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:105061:70"/>Mr. <hi>Moine hath both by word of mouth, and alſo by Letter under his hand declared that his mind about Epiſcopacy is not truly repreſented by this Letter, as Printed by Mr.</hi> Durel, <hi>many things being left out that would as much have croſſed his deſign, as thoſe which he hath publiſhed, do further it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to the Aſſembly that Mr. <hi>Durell</hi> hath called to decide our controverſies for us, he will have <hi>Joannes Amos Comenius</hi> the only ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving <hi>Bohemian</hi> Biſhop permitted to ſpeak firſt, and the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> deſire nothing more, they have ſome of them tranſlated a great deal of his Book into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they refuſe not to ſtand or fall by his <hi>Paraeneſis</hi> directed by name to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when it ſeemed ſollicitous concerning the beſt form of Church Government. Had not Mr. <hi>D.</hi> picked and culled out of the writings of the Divines whom he quotes juſt ſo much as would ſerve his turn, he had manifeſtly betrayed the cauſe of thoſe who have preferred him, in the judgment of unintereſted men; he hath done it conſequentially by referring Scholars to the Books of the Authors themſelves. For let a man go to the Letter of Monſieur <hi>Bochart</hi> written to Dr. <hi>Morley,</hi> and there he ſhall find that Presbytery is Ancienter than Epiſcopacy. The Reader alſo is directed to go to a Letter of Monſieur <hi>Vauquelins</hi> to prove that he thought the Book of common prayer very far from Popery and Superſtition, <hi>Page</hi> 278. but if he go to <hi>Page</hi> 189. he ſhall find he ſaith only that there is not in the Book any formal ſuperſtition, which certainly is not to ſay it is very far from ſuperſtition.</p>

            <p>I profeſs I know not any one Member of that Aſſembly Mr. <hi>D.</hi> would have called, that hath not in his writings ſaid more againſt the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Controverſies now on foot than for it.

Capell</hi> tells him his mind plainly, in his <hi>Theſes de divini verbi neceſſitate, Parag.</hi> 29. he ſaith, <hi>that there were by the Apoſtles themſelves inſtituted Churches, and in every one of them before their death, there was conſtituted by them a Colledge of Presbyters, by whoſe Labor, Miniſtry, and dayly Preaching, the Doctrine of the Goſpel might be propagated to the end of the World.</hi> In his Theſes about the vocation of Evangelical Miniſters, <hi>Parag.</hi> 11. <hi>The ordinary power of Preaching the Goſpel is that which by the Apoſtles is committed to their ſucceſſors, Presbyters being by them appointed in every City, in the Churches founded by them.

Ordinibus &amp; gradibus, <hi>He vohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently contends that the Miniſtry was properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by God to procure the eternal Salvation of men, and that the order of Presbyters alone may ſuffice to that end, and that the dignity and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of Biſhops above</hi> Presbyters is meerly of humane conſtitution, and that there was no cauſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105061:71"/>why <hi>the Biſhops and their Patrons ſhould ſo much on this cauſe and account, inſult and wax inſolent againſt thoſe whom invidiouſly they call Puritans, and Presbyterians.</hi> In his Theſes of the various Regiment of the Church, <hi>Parag.</hi> 15. <hi>He ſeverely cenſures the pompous mode of worſhip uſed in our Cathedrals,</hi> but <hi>Parag.</hi> 24. he ſaith plainly, <hi>that the</hi> Engliſh-<hi>men did not do unwiſely who threw the yoke of Epiſcopacy off their necks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ay, but in his Theſes about Liturgies he retracts what he had written about aboliſhing Hierarchical Government. <hi>Anſ.</hi> No man can ſee ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation but Mr. <hi>D.</hi> himſelf, who ſees by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramiſſion and not by intramiſſion, as we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, <hi>Page</hi> 193, 194. Had <hi>Capell</hi> intended any retractation he would have uſed plain words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting a revocation, or retractation of what he had before written, but he uſeth no words but what may well conſiſt with what he had before ſaid. When the ſame <hi>Capell</hi> comes to deliver his judgment about feſtivals, he even laughs at the reaſon or argument uſed by our great <hi>Hooker,</hi> to prove them by. But go we from <hi>Capell</hi> to Dr. <hi>Andrew Rivet,</hi> whoſe engagements and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to our Biſhops were perhaps greater, for that he was civilly treated by ſome of them, as he doth ſomewhere acknowledge; as alſo that at <hi>Oxford</hi> he had the Honorary degree of Doctor conferred on him. His judgment about Epiſcopacy we have ſeen before; about other things let him now have leave to ſpeak. Firſt, it is like enough that at the Univerſity be might obſerve that form of Oath, <hi>Ita me Deus adjuvet, &amp; ſancta Dei Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelia,</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:105061:71"/>whether that Oath ſtuck in his ſtomach or no, I cannot tell, but in his explication of the Decalogue, he puts this queſtion, <q>What is to be thought of that cuſtom which obtaineth in ſome Churches that have in other things thrown off the Popiſh ſuperſtitions, that he that ſweareth ſhould touch the Holy Bibles, or the Goſpels, or ſome part thereof. And anſwereth, if the words be conceived as among the Papiſts, ſo God help me and theſe Holy Goſpels, I ſee not how the reliques of ſuperſtition can be excuſed.</q> In the ſame explication of the Decalogue putting the queſtion concerning the Saints days obſerved here in <hi>England,</hi> he ſaith <q>he cannot approve the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe who accuſe our Church of Idolatry on that account, but wiſheth withal the cuſtom were amended, becauſe of the peril of Idolatry.</q> Juſt as our <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are accuſtomed to ſay. In his Comment on <hi>Exod.</hi> cap. 28. He handleth a queſtion about the ſpecial and peculiar veſtments of Miniſters, and hath theſe words. <hi>Whereas in</hi> England <hi>Miniſters put on linen veſtments, it were not to be indured, if they did this in imitation of the</hi> Jews, <hi>or for any myſtical ſignification. But how if they do it only for ſome diſtinction, yet ſtill we muſt be afraid of Gideons Ephod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the novelty of Organical Muſick, he ſpeaks expreſly and largely, eſpecially in his Preface to his comment on <hi>Hoſea,</hi> and in his <hi>Catholicus Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus</hi> againſt <hi>Baily.</hi> Where alſo he may be ſeen decrying the obſervation of Lent if it pretend to be Apoſtolical. He is indeed a moſt profeſſed Champion of the Presbyterian cauſe in almoſt every thing under debate.</p>
            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:105061:72"/>
            <p>As for <hi>Iſaac Caſaubon</hi> he was indeed a very Learned Critick, and for ought I know a perſon truly pious. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> accounts him his own, and therefore in the very title Page of his <hi>Vindiciae</hi> brings in his teſtimony to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> out of an Epiſtle written to <hi>Claudius Salmaſius, Quod ſime conjectura non fallit, totius Reformatoinis pars integerrima eſt in Anglia, ubi cum ſtudio veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis viget ſtudium antiquitatis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words are indeed found in an Epiſtle writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>raptim</hi> haſtily, by <hi>Caſaubon</hi> to <hi>Salmaſius</hi> much about that time when ſome of our Biſhops had declared their approbation of ſome of <hi>Caſaubons</hi> Theological Eſſaies, which ſundry Divines both from <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>France</hi> had diſliked. In this good mood <hi>Caſaubon</hi> commends the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the ſtudy of Antiquity, but at other times he grievouſly complains to <hi>Thuanus</hi> and <hi>Heinſius</hi> that we encourage no ſtudy but Theology. In the 604 Epiſ. he asks what good could come of inſtructing his two ſons in learning. <hi>Medicina hic ſane non viget. Juriſprudentia illa vetus &amp; vera plane jacet, vix de nomine paucis nota. Epiſtle</hi> 799. he intimates his deſign to ſend his ſon <hi>Merick</hi> to <hi>Heinſius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he deſired to have him well exerciſed in <hi>Greek, Latin, Hebrew,</hi> and could not hope that ſhould be done in <hi>England.</hi> Is not the ſtudy of Antiquity like to be carried on well where a young man cannot he trained up to any eminent skill in <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe we had not in this laſt Epiſtle been ſo extremely undervalued, had not the learned man been exaſperated by Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> whoſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105061:72"/>againſt <hi>Baronius,</hi> he judged very injurious to his own credit and reputation, as may be ſeen <hi>Epiſtle</hi> 717, 718. This may ſuffice to make us not to be proud of <hi>Caſaubons</hi> commendation; if I thought it not ſufficient, I could go near to prove, that <hi>Caſaubon</hi> judged men more or leſs ſtudious of antiquity, according as they were more or leſs zealous againſt the <hi>Arminians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I let paſs his ſynodical determinations, and come to his Sermon where I find him, <hi>Pag.</hi> 16. giving leave to <hi>Rome</hi> to rank our Reformers among <hi>the Contentious, if it can be found that either they have laid aſide, or taken up any one thing whereof it may be ſaid that the Holy Apoſtles, or Apoſtolick Churches had or had not ſuch a Cuſtom:</hi> he addes indeed, <hi>Rome was never able to do it, nor never ſhall.</hi> But ſhe knows well enough that ſhe can, for ſhe knows, that we have taken up Surplices which were not uſed by the Holy Apoſtles or any Apoſtolick Churches, and we give Baronies to our Biſhops which neither the Apoſtles nor any Apoſtolick Churches did, and we place our Baptiſteries in our Temples, which was done neither by Apoſtles nor Apoſtolical Churches. On the other ſide we have left off Unction, and Love-feaſts, and the Holy Kiſs, all which were uſed by the Apoſtles, and Apoſtolical Churches. So that <hi>Rome</hi> by Mr. <hi>D</hi>'s careleſly worded propoſition hath leave to reckon our Reformers among contentious ones.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 17. He uſeth a plain <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Argument to confirm and uphold the cauſe of the Church, for he ſaith, <hi>that the miraculous manner whereby it hath pleaſed God to raiſe her up ought to be to all an evident
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105061:73"/>proof that ſhe is her beloveds, and her beloved is hers, and an argument that her Reformation is certainly the work of God, and his Counſel which ſhall ſtand.</hi> Juſt thus the Papiſts were wont to prate when Popery was reſtored by Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> and juſt thus alſo did the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> argue when they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by God to conquer three flouriſhing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and to put all the Nations round about into a pannick fear. Let us not be high minded, but rejoice in trembling. God hath pleaded with us by his ſtrange judgments ſince Epiſcopacy was re-eſtabliſhed among us, we have had a ſharp war, a dreadful fire, a ſweeping Peſtilence; I do not ſay becauſe Epiſcopacy is reſtored, but becauſe ſin doth abound, and prophaneſs runs like a river and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty flowing ſtream; if we do not ſoundly humble our ſelves, God may ſoon take from us, his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, our Miniſters, and all that Reformation in the which we glory, and yet his Counſel will ſtand nevertheleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 22. He perfectly affronteth the expreſs words of our Church in the Liturgy, for there it is ſaid, <hi>that the commination of ſinners is uſed until the Primitive diſcipline of putting perſons convicted of notorious ſins to pennance at the beginning of Lent, and only until that diſcipline can be reſtored which is much to be wiſhed.</hi> But Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſaith, <hi>there can be nothing more powerful to touch ſinners to the quick, and to draw them from their evil courſes, than the Commination to which the whole Congregation is bound to ſay Amen, after every particular denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of Gods curſe, upon all ſorts of ſinners who perſiſt in their ſins.</hi> And indeed it is meet he ſhould
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105061:73"/>ſay ſo, for he had before given <hi>Rome</hi> leave to call us Contentious, if we had left off any cuſtom uſed in the Apoſtolick Churches, and we here do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that we have left off one that was very godly; indeed we ſay, it is to be wiſhed it were reſtored, but who hinders the reſtoring of it but our ſelves? Have other Churches power to enjoyn Penance, and have we none? Or will other people ſubmit to that diſcipline and not ours? Are not forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators put to open pennance, and why may not other ſinners be ſo puniſhed too? But not to multiply interrogatories, the Church holds pennance would be more powerful than the form of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination ſhe uſeth; Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſaith, nothing can be more powerful than the commination; he will ſure impoſe ſome pennance on himſelf for this boldneſs, and watch his Pen better for the time to come. Perhaps he will ſay his meaning was honeſt, and wholeſome, <hi>viz.</hi> that the form of Commination is very powerful to touch ſinners to the quick, if ſo, he may do well to conſider, 1. Whether it be conducible to tye Miniſters never to uſe it but on <hi>Aſhwedneſdays</hi> unleſs they have particular order from their Ordinaries, for why ſhould ſo powerful a preſervative againſt ſin be uſed but once a year, eſpecially ſeeing the uſe of it but once a year is found inſufficient to reclaim profaneneſs <hi>cum primis ſaluturis eſt caeremonia, ſed non video cur debeat exhiberi ſolum uno die, &amp; non ſaepius,</hi> ſaid the Great <hi>Bucer</hi> when he ſaw it reſtrained by the firſt Book of K. <hi>Edward</hi> to one day, thereupon it was altered in following Liturgies to <hi>divers times in the year. Grindals</hi> Articles enjoyned it to be uſed on ſome Sunday near the three great feaſts of the Church,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105061:74"/>
               <hi>Eaſter, Pentecoſt, Chriſtmas, Aſhwedneſday</hi> not excluded, but now no day is allowed but <hi>Aſhwed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday,</hi> unleſs there come an order from the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, which I have not heard that any Ordinary hath ſent ſince the return of his Majeſty. 2. What meaneth that mincing of the commination, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.16. the Text ſaith, <hi>Curſed is he that ſetteth light by Father and Mother,</hi> we ſay Curſed is he that curſeth Father and Mother, what if any ſhould from this take occaſion to think that there is no great danger in ſetting light by Father and Mother, provided they do not riſe ſo high in their impiety as to curſe them, (an iniquity that I hope few are guilty of) and what meaneth that addition to the curſe of the man that maketh any carved or molten image, <hi>viz.</hi> to worſhip it. In the Text there is no ſuch addition, and the Church did afterwards in the laſt commination curſe the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of images though now it be changed into Idolaters. The very making of ſome images, <hi>viz.</hi> of God, the Trinity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth entitle to a curſe whether they be worſhipped or no, and what hurt were it if people were made to know ſo much. 3. Why have we no curſe againſt prophane ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo common among us, nor any againſt Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion? The Scripture affordeth plenty of ſuch curſes.</p>
            <p>But as the Comminations is now ordered, I can ſay Amen to it, taking Amen not only as it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, <hi>ſo it is,</hi> but as it uſually ſignifieth <hi>ſo be it,</hi> ſo run the words in the Bible, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. ſo alſo, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5. And he is unworthy to be continued a Church member, who is like to curſe himſelf by
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105061:74"/>any ſuch imprecation, nor ſhall any man that ſo prayeth ſin againſt another that is guilty of thoſe ſins, for when we ſay Curſed is ſuch a ſinner, our meaning is if he continue, and whileſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth ſuch, and with that reſtriction we may ſay curſed be, as I doubt not but the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did as often as they uſed this ceremony appointed by God, ſo thought the <hi>Septuagint;</hi> elſe they would not have Tranſlated <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>P.</hi> 23. He ſaith we are appointed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, to receive the bleſſing from our Paſtor (as if none were our Paſtor but a Biſhop) <hi>and he gives it with the Impoſition of hands, and with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, without Chriſme, or any ſuch ſuperſtitious or ſuperfluous Ceremony.</hi> What words are theſe? they do indeed directly only reflect on the ancient Church and our firſt Reformers, and the compilers of the firſt Liturgy of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, by which chriſm was appointed at Baptiſm, though not that I find in Confirmation, by the Ancients I am ſure it was uſed in Confirmation; Mr. <hi>D.</hi> dare adventure to call it ſuperſtitious and ſuperfluous. But his words will by juſt conſequence reach the croſs in Baptiſm, uſed alſo in confirmation by the firſt Reformers, for why ſhould chriſme be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a ſuperſtitious and ſuperfluous Ceremony, rather than the croſs, the one is as Ancient as the other, and as innocent as the other, both were equally abuſed in Popery, of the two the Croſs may ſeem more ſuperfluous, for in Baptiſm, we
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105061:75"/>have an outward rite ſignifying the ſame thing that the Croſs is pretended to ſignifie; but to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie our unction by the Holy Ghoſt, which was in the firſt Liturgy prayed for, and ought ſtill to be prayed for, we have no outward rite at all; Nor do I fee why unction may not as well be uſed <hi>to certifie confirmed perſons of the unction from the Holy one,</hi> as impoſition of hands, <hi>to certifie them of Gods gracious favour and goodneſs towards them,</hi> which is made the end, in the Office of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>P. 26. <hi>If the ſeveral repetitions of the Lords-prayer, which are to be found in our Liturgy, were made immediately one after another, or within a ſhort time,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I ſay upon ſuch an account we might juſtly be cenſured for uſing vain repetitions.</hi> This wounds the Liturgy ſorely if it do not ſtrike it to the very heart, for not to ſay that it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſeveral Lords-prayers to be ſaid within a ſhort ſpace, (which may truly be ſaid) it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appoints repetitions of <hi>gloria Patri</hi> within a ſhort ſpace, and this will bring us within the guilt of vain repetitions, unleſs a reaſon can be given why <hi>gloria Patri</hi> may be repeated within a ſhort ſpace, and <hi>Pater noſter</hi> may not, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Mr. <hi>D.</hi> will give <hi>ad Graecas Calendas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I given you an account of Mr. <hi>D</hi>'s <hi>Engliſh</hi> Book under four heads, and now you will expect to have my judgment as touching his Latin Book called <hi>vindiciae ſacrae Eccleſiae Anglicanae.</hi> I ſay firſt that I know not what he means by his <hi>Eccleſia Anglicana,</hi> doth he mean the company of true believers or good Chriſtians (really or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatively
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105061:75"/>ſo) in <hi>England?</hi> if he do, <hi>quis Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemoniorum vituperat?</hi> why doth he make a vindication of that Church which none went about to accuſe? doth he mean by it the Biſhops of the ſeveral Dioceſſes in this Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> 'tis like he cannot mean them, for they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Sons of the Church, and we look on the Church as that to which the laſt complaint muſt be made, for ſo our Saviour directs, <hi>if thy Brother offend firſt tell him, then take with thee two or three, then tell the Church,</hi> now if any one ſhould injure a Biſhop (as for my part I judge Mr. <hi>D.</hi> hath grievouſly injured every one of them by dedicating ſuch a Volume of raileries to them) the Biſhop muſt firſt tell him by himſelf, and then take with him two or three, and if he regard not them, then he muſt tell the Church, that is himſelf if a Biſhop be the Church. 'Tis like by the Church he means the <hi>Church repreſentative,</hi> or <hi>Convocation,</hi> now there is a Canon, that denounceth an heavy penalty againſt thoſe, who deny the Convocation to be the Church of <hi>England</hi> by repreſentation, and I am fully reſolved not to come within the reach of that Canon, I love not excommengement. But if Mr. <hi>D.</hi> will take up the patronage of this Church Repreſentative, his beſt way had been firſt to prove that it is the Church Repreſentative, or elſe the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> will ſay that his whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is <hi>de non-ente.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Henry Jeanes</hi> had before he knew how things went in the world ſet forth a treatiſe (which it was my hap to read over) aſſerting the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that lay upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> Divines, to comply with
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105061:76"/>the Church: but in his retractations and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, thus he recalls himſelf, <q>I wonder upon what account I or any man elſe could think the Convocation to be the Church of <hi>England;</hi> if in any ſenſe it can be called the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it was becauſe it repreſented the Miniſtry of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that it did not, becauſe the far major part of it were Cathedral-men, Biſhops, Deans, Arch-Deacons, and ſuch as were choſen by the reſpective Chapters of each Cathedral: it might then be a Repreſentation of the Cathedral Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, but not of the Miniſtry of <hi>England,</hi> and that I make good by two Parallels. The firſt ſhall be betwixt our Convocation, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent:</hi> many ſober and moderate Papiſts accuſed this to be a pack'd Aſſembly, a Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of, not the Catholick Church, but the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe the greateſt part of it were of the Popes Faction, and depended wholly upon him: So the major part of our Convocations were of the Biſhops Faction, and minded chiefly the intereſt of Cathedrals: and therefore were not a Repreſentative of all the Miniſters in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> I ſhall exemplifie this by inſtancing in the Dioceſs of <hi>Bathe</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> wherein I lived: In this there were Members of the lower houſe of Convocation, one Dean, three Arch-Deacons, and one choſen by the Chapter of <hi>Wells:</hi> and to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance theſe, there were but two Clarks choſen by the Miniſtry of the whole Dioceſs: Now what impartial man but will determine that theſe ſeven could be no due repreſentation of the Miniſters of the Dioceſs of <hi>Bathe</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> as long as five of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105061:76"/>them were Members of the Cathedral, in whoſe Election the Miniſters of the Dioceſs had no hand at all? A ſecond parallel ſhall be betwixt our Convocation and a civil Aſſembly, wherein we will ſuppoſe that the Prince chuſeth three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, who are his Courtiers, or elſe ſuch as have their dependance, either wholly, or in great part upon him, and the Nation chuſe only a hundred: you may call this Aſſembly a Parliament, or what you will; but ſurely no rational man can think it to be a repreſentation of the Nation, and as ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational, were it to call the Convocation a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> ſeeing thoſe choſen by the Miniſters were an inconſiderable part of the Convocation.</q> Mr. <hi>D.</hi> belongeth to a Cathedral, nay as report goes to ſeveral Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals, and therefore he had done but a piece of gratitude, to vindicate the Church from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of a backſlider from Conformity. Well, let him mean what he will by his Holy Church of <hi>England,</hi> we are told that he himſelf is <hi>Presbyter of this Holy Church of England,</hi> and that is a ſtrange and very unuſual phraſe. Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved well of the Hierarchy, in his Title page of his Diſſertations, calls himſelf, <hi>Presbyterum An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glicanum,</hi> and yet he was born in <hi>England,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in <hi>England,</hi> and by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhop, <hi>John Durell</hi> was born in <hi>Jerſey,</hi> ordained in <hi>France,</hi> and by a <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Biſhop, and yet he calls himſelf <hi>Eccleſiae Anglicanae Presbyterum.</hi> I doubt if things were throughly ſearched into, he would appear to be no <hi>Engliſh Presbyter,</hi> for we admit no Presbyters, but thoſe who are canonically ordained, <hi>i. e.</hi> by a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105061:77"/>Biſhop; you'l ſay Mr. <hi>D.</hi> was ordained by a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and he tells you the name of the Biſhop, and his title: I know he doth, but I ask who made him a Biſhop and a Presbyter? I much fear we ſhall find him one that was never ordained Presbyter but by Presbyters, or by thoſe who had been them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves created Presbyters by meer Presbyters, though conſecrated in <hi>England</hi> by Biſhops; and if ſo, then <hi>vitium primae concoctionis, non corrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in ſecundá aut tertiâ.</hi> Let him well conſider this, and if occaſion be, get himſelf re-ordained by ſome Biſhop of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood and Ordination, elſe any one who envies him his preferments may chance to pick a hole in his coat. If he know not the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Biſhops, it is in brief thus. In the year 1610, King <hi>James</hi> ſent for Mr. <hi>John Spotſwood,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gawen Hamilton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Andrew Lamb</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> that an Epiſcopal Character might be imprinted on them; to that end he iſſued out a Commiſſion under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to the Biſhops of <hi>London, Ely, Wells,</hi> and <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> requiring them to proceed to the Conſecration of three <hi>Scotch</hi>-men deſigned to be Biſhops, which Conſecration they did perform accordingly, <hi>Octob.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, 1610. But Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> moved a ſcruple how the perſons to be conſecrated, were capable of Epiſcopal Conſecration, ſeeing none of them had been formerly ordained Prieſts. Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> tells us Hiſt. of <hi>Preſ.</hi> p. 387. <hi>The ſcruple was removed by Archbiſhop</hi> Bancroſt, <hi>alledging, that there was no ſuch neceſſity of receiving Prieſthood, but that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal Conſecrations might be given without it;</hi> but he neither tells us the Objection nor Anſwer aright:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:105061:77"/>the Objection was, That the three <hi>Scots</hi> could not be conſecrated Biſhops, becauſe they had never been made Presbyters, but by Presbyters; to which <hi>Bancroft</hi> replyed, That the Ordination of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by Presbyters was valid. But our preſent Biſhops are not of the ſame mind, and therefore before they would conſecrate Mr. <hi>James Sharp,</hi> they firſt ordained him Deacon, then Prieſt, and this they did not out of a pike or ſpleen againſt the man, but from judgement, conceiving he would not ordain others <hi>legitimè,</hi> unleſs he were ſo ordained; ſuch as are by him ordained are capable regularly of preferment among us, but ſo are not any of the former brood of men, that were ordained by <hi>Scotch</hi> Biſhops. This diſcourſe is only deſigned to keep Mr. <hi>D.</hi> from deſpiſing the Presbyterians too much, to which he would be tempted if he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himſelf to ſtand on a <hi>baſis</hi> as firm as ſome of his fellow Prebends. I adviſe him alſo not to be too forward to publiſh to the world how he hath let the Miniſters of forreign Churches, Preach in his Church at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> for doubtleſs it is againſt the Act of Uniformity to let them Preach, though but occaſionally in that Church, unleſs they have been ordained by ſome Biſhops, becauſe that Church at the <hi>Savoy</hi> hath ſubmitted to the Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> as Paſtor, and ſo hath not the immunities, that other <hi>French</hi> Churches may claim, and do claim.</p>
            <p>As to the Book it ſelf, common fame ſpreads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that an Anſwer in <hi>Latin</hi> is preparing for it. We muſt expect and ſee what kind of thing it will be; for we may well conceive it will diſcover Mr.

               <hi>D.</hi> to be <hi>John Lack-truth, John Lack-modeſty.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain I am, there be School-boys in <hi>England,</hi> that can diſcover him to be no familiar of <hi>Priſcian;</hi> we lay-men can manifeſt that he had no regard to truth; and for modeſty, he doth all-along bid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to it.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> of eminent learning and piety, the only ſurviving member of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> is with him but a pitiful fellow. He dares venture to cenſure <hi>Thomas Gataker,</hi> than whom <hi>England</hi> ſcarce ever had either a more exact Critick, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed Divine. Nay, that you may ſee his pride to the full, he was not aſhamed to tell an Honourable perſon of this Nation, that one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which moved him to fall upon Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was, becauſe the <hi>Latin</hi> Apologiſt for the Nonconform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, had repreſented him <hi>as no equal match for Mr.</hi> Baxter. Could you think it poſſible that Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſhould conceit himſelf meet to cope with ſuch an Antagoniſt, whom the Reformed Divines (who can underſtand the language in which his books are written) admire; to whom <hi>Amyrald</hi> not long ſince ſent a Letter on purpoſe to let him know that he had never ſpoken contemptibly of him. Mr. <hi>Gaches</hi> is ſufficiently depredicated by Mr. <hi>D.</hi> as an Eloquent Preacher, and as one of the beſt men living His Letter to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is printed; by that let the world make eſtimation of him: or if Mr. <hi>Gaches</hi> teſtimonial can be diſcredited, then let <hi>the Saints everlaſting reſt,</hi> the <hi>Treatiſe againſt Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> and whatever elſe he hath written, be read and meditated upon ſeriouſly, there will ſcarce be found a Divine in whom there was a more happy
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:105061:78"/>conjunction of eloquence and judgment, of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and peaceableneſs. Not to detain you long, I ſhall make a few general animadverſion on the Book, and ſo put an end to theſe papers which are grown too big.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Author of the</hi> Vindiciae <hi>egregiouſly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Act of Indempnity and Oblivion,</hi> that buried all former miſcarriages, he rakes them all out of the grave, as if he had no belief of the general judgment. If any <hi>Presbyterians</hi> made any application to ſuch as in the late times took upon them ſupreme authority, he ſcores that up as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt <hi>Presbytery.</hi> Could any <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> be ſo vile as to imitate him, how eaſily might he tell him of a Primate of <hi>England,</hi> and Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan, who took up arms in the cauſe of the two Houſes, and had a great ſum voted him for his good ſervice: Of a Conformiſt who was the prime Author of <hi>Jus Divinum regiminis Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtici:</hi> Of an Epiſcopal Divine now enjoying a good Living, who did write <hi>Politica Sacra &amp; Civilia:</hi> Of ſundry dignified men who came into ſequeſtred places, and verſified in behalf of the Protector. The late Wars began when I was a Child, and were finiſhed before I was a man; but I have made the beſt enquiry that I could, and do find that ſundry of the moſt eminent Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts were alway unſatisfied about the Parliaments War, and did not ſtick as occaſion was offered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their diſſatisfaction. I have found alſo, that the Divines moſt buſie to bring about the late unhappy and deplorable changes, were ſuch as had been of the moſt rigid Sect of the Conformiſts; Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:105061:79"/>in his <hi>Gangraena</hi> hath named ſome of them: I muſt not without leave from thoſe who ſit at the Stern, do ſo; but I profeſs I know not that Theologue who did either ſpeak or write for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the King to death, that had not been a Conformiſt before the Wars. The men now in place who loſt any thing for refuſing the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will be found to be very few; ſome will be ſound to come into the places of thoſe who were turned out for not engaging. Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> himſelf (as hot as he is againſt thoſe who go by the name of <hi>Presbyterians</hi>) did <hi>Anno</hi> 1657. put forth his <hi>Eccleſia vindicata,</hi> much of ſuch a ſtrain as Mr. <hi>Durell</hi>'s <hi>Vindiciae;</hi> in the general Preface to that Book, he addreſſeth himſelf to thoſe who were then in power, and pleads for the men of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, by this argument, <hi>That they lived ſo peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and inoffenſively in their ſeveral ſtations, as that they could not be reproached with any diſaffection to the then preſent Government in word or deed.</hi> Had ſome eminent man called a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> ſaid ſo much for thoſe of his perſwaſion, what would Mr. <hi>D.</hi> have made of it? But the Reformed Religion may ſay, <hi>All theſe things are againſt me.</hi> Mr. <hi>D.</hi> makes the Principles of the <hi>Engliſh Presbyterians</hi> to lead to Rebellion. Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> long ſince equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the <hi>Puritans</hi> beyond the ſeas, with the Jeſuits, in point of diſloyalty. Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> hath driven the ſame nail further and deeper; nothing is wanting but ſome hot-headed fellow among the Proteſtants to lay Treaſon at the door of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and then the cry of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will be fulfilled. But ſtill the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:105061:79"/>Proteſtant will be white as ſnow; in vain is it ſo to think. The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the matter of the Militia, and declared it unlawful on any account whatſoever to take up Arms againſt the King. Men will acquieſce in this Declaration, if not for Conſcience-ſake, yet at leaſt for fear. I know no Book put out ſince his Majeſties return, that hath aſſerted the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſubjects riſing againſt their Soveraign, but one ſet forth as <hi>Mr. Rich. Hookers,</hi> and dedicated with the reſt of his Works by Biſhop <hi>Gauden</hi> to the King himſelf. <hi>Mr. Iſaac Walton</hi> would have us think the Book is not his; and I wiſh he had brought better arguments to bring us to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion. But I am ſure that Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> hath left things upon record which may vye with any thing quoted out of <hi>Calvin</hi> or <hi>Beza,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Heylin.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. This Vindex when he meets in the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt with that he dares not juſtifie, preſently puts it into his Catalogue of Legends, yet brings no probable arguments to prove it a Legend. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologiſt, whoever he was, ſeems to have written his Book under much bodily weakneſs, and hath plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his brethren in Nonconformity rather ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly than fully; but as for the things that Mr. <hi>D.</hi> calls ſables, I my ſelf know many, if not all of them, to be true, and dare undertake to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe who will atteſt them upon oath; yet if I could meet with the Apologiſt handſomely, I would ſeverely rebuke him for putting ſome of them into print, for all truths are not to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed at all times. I remember I once heard him that is the reputed Author of the Apology, ſay in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105061:80"/>a Sermon, <hi>A man can ſcarce do a worſe office to the Church, than to render Paſtors deſpicable in the eyes of thoſe whom they are to govern.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. This Vindex when he falls into the mention of any Controverſie that ſhould be debated by him, takes his heels, and runs away from it, and drops ſome queſtion about the which there was never any diſpute. Twenty and ten inſtances might be given of this kind; I only take notice of one; he hath a Chapter <hi>utris magis faverit Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> &amp;c. Whether <hi>Calvin</hi> moſt favoured the Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Presbyterians, or Prelates? If this be to anſwer the Apologiſt, then let ſome one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, put a queſtion, Whether <hi>Calvin</hi> moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured <hi>Arminian</hi> Prelates, or Presbyterians? What hath Schiſm to do in the Controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Nonconformity? The greater part of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts cannot be guilty of Schiſm, except they were guilty of it in their mothers womb, or when they ſucked, or whilſt they were School-boys: for thus the caſe ſtood with them; they were by their Parents ſent to the Univerſity when Biſhops were <hi>inter non-entia,</hi> or <hi>inter non apparentia.</hi> By ſtudy they came to acquire thoſe gifts that were ſuppoſed to qualifie them for the Miniſtry; to the work of the Miniſtry they were ſeperated by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery; yet many of them never declared diſlike of Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, nor opened their mouths againſt Ceremonies; never took the Covenant nor Engagement; were preſented to vacant Livings by the true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Patrons: By Gods bleſſing they added to the Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved. His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties

            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> I may expect you will thus accoſt me: If Mr. <hi>D.</hi> be ſo eaſily maſtered, why do you not pay a debt of love you owe? why do you not write in <hi>Latin</hi> as once Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> did in <hi>Engliſh, A Plea for the Innocent?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Reſp.</hi> Verily for this reaſon, becauſe I love not to have to do with thoſe, who when they are put to ſilence, know not how to be aſhamed; ſuch a one this <hi>Monſieur</hi> is; for not long ago he met with a Noble Gentleman of this Nation, who hearing him ſay, <hi>That all the Divines beyond ſeas condemned the Engliſh Nonconformiſts,</hi> told him plainly, <hi>That he knew it was not ſo; and that ſome in</hi> France <hi>looked on him as an apoſtate for complying ſo far as he had done;</hi> and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>Theſe are only ſome unwiſe hot-headed men;</hi> the honourable perſon rejoined, <hi>Nay, they are worthy and well tempered Miniſters.</hi> Yet did not <hi>Mr. D.</hi> change the copy of his countenance.

            <p>LOng time after I had written the Appendix againſt Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> I was informed, that ſomething elſe was come abroad in <hi>Latin,</hi> in the which the Nonconformiſts were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. I could not think any thing was ſaid in it, that had not been ſaid before, and therefore I had once ſome thoughts, never ſo much as to look into it, but being told that the Author of it was Mr. <hi>Matthew Scrivener,</hi> reputed at <hi>Cambridge</hi> (while he there reſided) a cloſe Student, and great Scholar; I reſolved, to caſt my eye upon ſome Pages of it, that ſo, if it ſeemed written with any candor and judgement, I might either give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it, or tell ſuch Nonconforming friends, as I was acquainted with, that I found it unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. But looking into it, at the Stationers ſhop, I ſoon found it to be made up of little beſides ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility and calumny. Monſieur <hi>Daillees</hi> Book of the <hi>Right uſe of the Fathers,</hi> which I thought no Proteſtant had looked on without admiration, nor Papiſt without terror, this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Presbyter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to anſwer, endeavours firſt of all to make it appear, that the Book deſerved not the <hi>Elogiums</hi> that ſome of great name and eſteem among us had beſtowed upon it, and that Mr. <hi>Daillee</hi> was but a <hi>Cham, taking delight to lay open the nakedneſs of the Fathers.</hi> Then proceeds to give him a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and particular anſwer. I confeſs I was moved
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:105061:82"/>not a little, to ſee a writer that had deſerved ſo well of the Reformed Religion, ſo unworthily dealt with, by one pretending to be a Proteſtant. For what one thing hath Mr. <hi>J. D.</hi> ſaid more or leſs about the Fathers, than what had been ſaid many years before by ſome of our moſt eminent Divines in <hi>England?</hi> It muſt be acknowledged, that he hath handled the point more copioufly, than any who went before him; and the heads of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe are exemplified with a moſt admirable col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of particulars; but that he hath brought the Fathers any one peg lower than they had been brought by <hi>Juel, Humfred, Whitaker, Rainolds,</hi> Dr. <hi>George Abbot, Down,</hi> &amp;c. will never be proved. Biſhop <hi>Coſins</hi> hath put together all the reaſons that were ſcattered and diſperſed in other mens writings, to prove the Non-canonicalneſs of the Apocryphal Books; now it would be no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if a Proteſtant in ſome writing ſhould <hi>obiter</hi> take notice, that the Biſhop in ſome particular had miſtook himſelf; but he that ſhould profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly undertake to anſwer him, would ſcarce be accounted other than a Papiſt. <hi>e. c.</hi> The Biſhop ſaith, p. 18. <hi>All the Canonical Books of the Old Teſtament were originally written in Hebrew</hi> (<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>but theſe other books</hi> (he means thoſe canonized at <hi>Trent</hi>) <hi>were all confeſſedly firſt written in the Greek tongue,</hi> &amp;c.) I may doubt whether all the controverted books were firſt written in the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, I may confidently affirm this is not confeſſed concerning all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted books (for who knows not that <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticus</hi> is generally affirmed to be written firſt in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105061:82"/>
               <hi>Hebrew,</hi> to ſay nothing of other books) and yet not be thought ſpightful nor Popiſh; but if I ſhould publiſh a whole book againſt the Biſhop, labouring to leſſen his reputation and eſteem, to weaken the authorities by him produced, would not any man ſay, that either I was a Papiſt, or that I cared not how much I gratified the Papiſt, ſo I could but ſhow my teeth againſt Biſhop <hi>Coſins?</hi> yet juſt ſuch a game it is that Mr. <hi>Scrivener</hi> plays.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But if what he hath ſaid againſt <hi>Daillee</hi> be truth, if his anſwers to him be rational, is it not meet he ſhould be honoured? Will it not be for our credit and reputation, to let the <hi>Papiſts</hi> know, that we will not ſpare our own, how renowned ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, where they exceed the bounds of modeſty and ſobriety?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> If any one through a zeal (without knowledg) againſt Popery, ſhall ſay thoſe things againſt the Fathers that may diſcourage thoſe who have leaſure and money from buying and reading of them; or ſo weaken their authority, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the intereſt of Chriſtianity; he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve praiſe and commendation who ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bring the Fathers to their due eſteem. But neither hath Mr. <hi>Daillee</hi> wronged the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor Mr. <hi>Scrivener</hi> righted them: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Mr. <hi>Scrivener</hi> heard a Presbyterian in a Sermon put off an objection taken from the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Fathers by referring his hearers to Mr. <hi>Daillee,</hi> therefore he reſolves to encounter Mr. <hi>Daillee.</hi> And as ſpleen ſeems to be the chief thing that put him on this undertaking, ſo in the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of it he hath diſcovered more of petulant
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:105061:83"/>ſpleen, than of judgment. This cenſure I had ſome purpoſe to make good, but that 1. I am aſſured that <hi>Daillee</hi> is like in a ſhort time to be vindicated by ſome of his own. 2. I am now alſo fallen into a place where I can have no books but what my own Library affords; and though I have moſt of the ancient Fathers of ſome Edition, yet in a matter of this nature, I ſhall neither be able to ſatisfie my ſelf nor others, unleſs I had opportunity to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult all the Editions of them, or at leaſt the moſt renowned. For it often happeneth, that when a man thinketh he hath the Fathers on his ſide, and hath brought their teſtimonies too plain to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded for his opinion, he reapeth no benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, becauſe thoſe who differ from him, deny the copies according to which he proceedeth, to be ſuch as are to be relied on. It was my hap not long ſince to read Dr. <hi>Waltons Prolegomena,</hi> that I might ſee what he could ſay for the comparative novelty of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Letters that we at preſent uſe; among other arguments I found him to make uſe of the authority of <hi>Euſebius</hi> his Chronicle <hi>ad annum mundi</hi> 4740. the words quoted out of him are theſe, <hi>Fuit Eſdras eruditiſſimus legis divinae, &amp; clarus omnium Judaeorum magiſter, qui de cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitate regreſſi ſuerunt in Judaeam: affirmatur<expan>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:105061:83"/>only ſaith <hi>affirmatur,</hi> cannot be concluded ſo much as to deliver his own opinion. Many Hiſtorians and Chronographers uſe <hi>affirmatur,</hi> or ſome word of like import in ſuch matters as they themſelves do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and I hope for the credit of <hi>Euſebius</hi> that he did not think <hi>Eſdram divinas ſcripturas memoriter condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſe;</hi> and if ſo, it is not like that he believed the other part of the affirmation neither. But Mr. <hi>Baily,</hi> a learned and induſtrious <hi>Scotch</hi>-man, in his lately publiſhed Hiſtorical and Chronological Work, lib. 1. p. 197. tells me, <q>That he had read over and over <hi>Euſebius</hi> his Chronicle, as well the Greek as the Latin Copy ſet forth by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> with great care out of the beſt Manuſcripts, and could not find one word in them concerning this change of Letters by <hi>Eſdras;</hi> and yet if <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> had in any Copy of good repute found any thing that might have confirmed this change of Letters, he would no doubt have inſerted it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth with ſo much paſſion take upon him to defend that change.</q> Now if this be true, as I doubt it is, that Dr. <hi>Walton</hi> in his prologue to ſo renowned a Work as the <hi>Polyglotts,</hi> followed a Tranſlation of <hi>Euſebius</hi> that was corrupted, I may well be affrighted from examining teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Fathers, till I be where I may be aſſured that the teſtimonies I am to examine are not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited. In the mean time I ſhall lay down ſome few things concerning the Fathers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Many times the uſefulneſs and almoſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of being acquainted with the Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Languages and the Writings of the Fathers, is moſt cried up by thoſe who themſelves are but ſtrangers to them. It is not many years ſince a ſon
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105061:84"/>of the Church at a Lecture in the Countrey, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the neceſſity of the knowledge of the Original <hi>Hebrew,</hi> affirming that they were not worthy the name of Divines who did not well underſtand it; but this pert young man being at Dinner taken to task about his own skill in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> it was found that he could not ſo much as read <hi>Hebrew;</hi> yet he was out-done by the bold <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> who (as <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chior Adam</hi> relates the ſtory in his life, <hi>pag.</hi> 845.) in a Diſpute with <hi>Graſerus</hi> about the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text of the Bibles, made boaſt of his skill in <hi>Hebrew;</hi> but this Father of the ſociety having an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without points put into his hands, knew not which was the top, which was the bottom of the Pages, which occaſioned <hi>Graſerus</hi> his Scholar to laugh at his daring ignorance; ſo that the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who brought this Father, withdrew, and wiſh'd him, ſo ignorant, to be gone. They who have read the reaſons of <hi>Edmund Campian,</hi> cannot but know how much he boaſted of the Fathers, as if they had been all his own from firſt to laſt, even as much as <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>13th:</hi> on this account he earneſtly deſired to be admitted to diſpute with our Divines. <hi>Quo quo ſe moverit adverſarius, feret incommodum: Patres admiſerit captus eſt; Excluſerit, nullus eſt.</hi> But when this vain-glorious creature came to be diſputed with, it was found that he could not underſtand a <hi>Greek</hi> Father, and that it might well be queſtioned whether he could ſo much as read <hi>Greek.</hi> Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> plainly tells him in the third days conference, that it was not above a dozen years ſince he heard him at <hi>Oxford</hi> ask a Stationer for <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s Epiſtles. In the fourth days conference,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:105061:84"/>when Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> brought <hi>Tertullians</hi> Book againſt <hi>Hermogenes</hi> to prove the Scriptures ſufficiency, he knew of no ſuch book; and yet when he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that there was ſuch a book, then he could anſwer, and pretended to know upon what account <hi>Tertullian</hi> argued againſt <hi>Hermogenes?</hi> And he pretended in the ſame days conference, that he knew the meaning of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and yet would not, or could not read the place in <hi>Greek,</hi> though it were eaſie, and the ſentence ſhort, and though he knew not where to find it in the <hi>Latin</hi> book. So it ſeemed not improbable to ſome that <hi>Campian</hi> made not that confident Pamphlet, but only turned it into good <hi>Latin. Thompſon</hi> alſo in his Treatiſe <hi>de Amiſſione &amp; Interciſione juſtificationis, &amp; gratiae,</hi> muſters up the teſtimonies of many Fathers; but when his book was only manuſcript, one who knew him, asked him this queſtion, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde tot Patrum teſtimonia uſurparet, qui patres vix quidem attigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet?</hi> I could ſhew the like ignorance and confidence in another <hi>Arminian,</hi> who troubled Mr. <hi>Robert Baily</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with teſtimonies of Fathers againſt Predeſtination, but ſuch as were all taken out of <hi>Voſſius,</hi> and concluded them with an <hi>Item,</hi> that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> acknowledged the Fathers to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, quoting as <hi>Voſſius</hi> through an overſight had done, <hi>Beza</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.39. when as that Chapter hath but 33 Verſes in it. And <hi>Calvins</hi> third book of Inſtitutions 33 Chapter, when there be but 25 Chapters in that whole book. I could alſo diſcover a great many now living who carry it in their Sermons and Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as if they followed the ancient Fathers, when
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:105061:85"/>indeed they follow none but <hi>Hugh Groot.</hi> But would I by all this inſinuate, that Mr. <hi>Scrivener</hi> is not well verſed in the Fathers, for whom he Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logizeth? I anſwer, I would inſinuate no more, but that it is poſſible that all his pretended zeal for the Fathers may be without any great knowledge of them. What the courſe of his Studies hath been, I know not, his friends were wont to think, that his genius led him rather to School-men, than Fathers (if it did ſo, he is not the worſe to be liked; for of the two, a Miniſter who hath the cure of ſouls, may better want Patriſtical than Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical Theology); I ſuppoſe it would a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſe his gravity to be catechized any whit ſtrictly concerning the age, ſtile and deſign of ſome of the Fathers whom he undertakes to defend; if in this I be miſtaken, the matter is not great, for I deſign it only to keep our Prieſts from boaſting of a falſe gift.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I never yet in all my life met with any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any perſwaſion whatſoever, that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from any opinion he had at firſt imbibed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one or more Fathers were againſt him. We all firſt take up our opinions from the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſms, or Confeſſions that are authorized in thoſe Churches of which we are members, and many, that I ſay not moſt, go all their days by an implicit faith, believing as the Church believes, and as their Miniſters do Preach, never taking pains to ſearch whether they agree to the Canon of Faith. <hi>Popiſh</hi> Divines think that their Church cannot err, and ſo ſtrain all their learning and diligence to defend what ſhe hath determined; all that call themſelves Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:105061:85"/>ſay they ought to uſe their judgement of diſcretion, though they may be bound, if in ſome comparatively leſs matters, they have knowledge different from the Church in which they are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to have it to themſelves. This is truth, but the men who do conſcientiouſly and impartially make uſe of their judgement of diſcretion, are not very many, they are very ſoon tyed up by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, and account it not for their credit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from them; if in diſputation they be preſſed with the authority of the Fathers or ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, they either bluntly declare that they little regard them, or elſe find out ſome plauſible <hi>ſalvo,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to elude them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some will flatly declare that they do not much matter what mind the Fathers are of. The great Patron of Ubiquity <hi>Jacobus Andraeas</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by <hi>Scultetus</hi> in his <hi>Nuncupatory</hi> to his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla,</hi> not to value the Fathers at all, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> with him was <hi>Sathanaſius, Vigilius, Dormilius,</hi> and all the <hi>Patres</hi> he would in contempt call <hi>Matres,</hi> that is, I ſuppoſe, weak and ſilly creatures, unfit to be uſed as guides and directors in matters of Religion. The Papiſts themſelves, as great a ſhew as they ſometimes make of Fathers, do at other times uſe language not much more civil concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Was it not a Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his eſteem of the learning of <hi>Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> to be ſo great, <hi>that he doubted not to give unto him the firſt place after the Canonical Scripture?</hi> Such a Speech is fathered upon one of the <hi>Innocents</hi> by <hi>Auguſtin Hunne,</hi> if I may credit Dr. <hi>G. Abbot</hi> againſt <hi>Hill, Pag.</hi> 426. and I ſuppoſe I may well
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:105061:86"/>credit him, becauſe I find as much in <hi>Alvarez de Auxiliis, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 52. Indeed to almoſt all truly and throughly <hi>Popiſh</hi> Writers, the Fathers are but Children, his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> as they call him, is all in all with them. <hi>Suarez in</hi> 3. <hi>Com.</hi> 1. <hi>qu.</hi> 2. <hi>not.</hi> 2. <hi>diſp.</hi> 42. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. ſaith, <hi>The definition of the Pope is altogether true; and if it ſhould be contrary to the ſayings of all Saints, it were to be preferred to them.</hi> Bellar. lib. 4. de Pon. cap. 5. <hi>If the Pope ſhould err by commanding vices, or prohibiting vertues, the Church would be bound to believe vices to be good, and vertues bad, unleſs ſhe would ſin againſt her conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Cornelius Mus</hi> in his Comments on the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> p. 606. e. g. <hi>I, to confeſs ingenuouſly, would more believe the Pope alone in thoſe things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the myſteries of faith, than a thouſand</hi> Auſtins, Hieroms, Gregories, <hi>&amp;c. becauſe the Pope in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith cannot err.</hi> Much ſuch ranting ſtuff I could quote, did I count it needful; but indeed it is not needful, for his Holineſs takes upon him to have a power to correct Fathers, that they may juſt fit and ſuit the preſent ſtate of his Church. By the Conſtitution of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth, care is taken to ſet out Fathers free from the corruptions they have contracted by coming through the hands of Hereticks, but with this proviſo, <hi>That if any more weighty doubts and difficulties ſhall happen in the authority of old Books, in the correction and emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of books, things being firſt examined in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, they ſhould be referred to him, that in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of readings he might determine that by a ſpecial priviledge granted to his See, which was moſt conſonant to orthodox verity:</hi> and leſt we ſhould think that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:105061:86"/>the Pope muſt determine nothing of his own head, but after he hath taken great pains, hear <hi>Gregory de Valentia Analyſis fidei,</hi> lib. 8. p. 70. <hi>Non eſt ratio ulla firma quamobrem exiſtimare debeamus, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dii diligentiam Pontifici eſſe neceſſariam, ſive in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiendo ſtudium adhibeat ſive non adhibeat, infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter certe definiet.</hi> But this it may be is ſaid but by one, and a long time ſince; not ſo, we ſhall find our Countrey-man <hi>Thomas Bacon,</hi> or <hi>Southwell</hi> in his <hi>Analyſis fidei</hi> ſaying as much.</p>
            <p>But do not <hi>Calviniſts</hi> as much ſet at naught the Fathers when they make not for them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> So they are charged to do by Papiſts, and the Remonſtrants, and their adherents. <hi>Campian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cauſaeus</hi> called <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite</hi> a <hi>doting old man;</hi> but Dr. <hi>Humphred</hi> denies him to have uſed any ſuch broad language even of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Dionyſius, De Patribus,</hi> p. 520, &amp;c. <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> alſo gives them ſuch a bob <hi>pag.</hi> 15. <hi>Piet.

            <p n="2">2. Some hating to ſpeak contemptibly of the Fathers, will civilly put off their authority, either by putting another ſenſe on their words than is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly given, or by blaming the edition, or the tranſlation, or by oppoſing one Father to another, or the ſame Father to himſelf, or by ſaying that he relates the opinion of others: So that they do by them, juſt as they do at <hi>Oxford</hi> by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> his authority muſt not be denied in diſputations under a penalty appointed by the Statutes, yet any one in <hi>Paerviſiis,</hi> or <hi>Auguſtinenſibus</hi> holds the opinion that he beſt liketh, how contrary ſoever it be to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:105061:87"/>
               <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> and if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> be urged againſt him, <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur ad modum vulgi, diſputative, non doctrinali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> &amp;c. ſerves well enough to put him by, and ſhift him off.</p>
            <p>The day is yet, I ſuppoſe, to come that ever any Scholar in diſputation ſaid, <hi>I find that</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>is againſt me, and therefore I do revoke and recall my opinion, promiſing to be of another mind for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> If the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks do not uſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers juſt ſo, then let me be accounted to bear falſe witneſs againſt them. In the general that caution of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Cenſors is well known, and extant in the Chapter concerning <hi>Bertram. In veteribus aliis plurimos ferimus errores, &amp; extenuamus, excuſamus excogitato commento, perſaepe negamus &amp; commodum eis ſenſum affingimus, dum opponuntur in diſputatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus aut in conflictionibus cum adverſariis.</hi> This affixing of a commodious ſenſe to the Fathers, is a ſhield that will quench all darts; by help of this, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thought himſelf able to avoid the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Propoſitions of the Fathers, concerning the extent of Original ſin, ſo as to leave room and place for the immaculate conception of the Virgin <hi>Mary, De Amiſ.

Could he not ſay <hi>that he related only the opinion of others, as he doth concerning</hi> Hierom? Lib. de gratia primi hominis, <hi>cap.</hi> 11. or that he ſpake <hi>hyperbolically,</hi> as he brings off <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> lib. 2. de Miſſ. cap. 10. <hi>or that he did write after the manner of Poets,</hi> which he ſaith about <hi>Prudentius, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Purg. cap.</hi> 18. Why could he not ſay, that writing againſt one extreme, he fell into the other extreme; a <hi>ſalvo</hi> often brought when ſome of the Fathers ſayings are brought, that ſeem to favour <hi>Manichaeiſm</hi> or <hi>Pelagianiſm, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſm</hi> or <hi>Sabellianiſm.</hi> If no ſuch thing would ſerve the turn, why then it might have been ſaid, that he ſpoke <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction uſed by St. <hi>Baſil</hi> to fetch off <hi>Gregory, Epiſ.</hi> 64. but made uſe of by more than one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt; or rather than fail, it might have been ſaid, that <hi>Origen</hi> was abuſed and corrupted.</p>
            <p>Q. What then, is no authority to be aſcribed to the Fathers?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There may be authority enough aſcribed to them, notwithſtanding any thing I have ſaid; for I have only related how men deal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not how they ought to deal with them. Yet I confeſs I am ſomewhat to ſeek how to draw ſuch an argument from the authority of the Fathers, as
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:105061:88"/>none but deſperate perſons will think invalid. Should I, meeting with an Adverſary that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from me, argue thus, <hi>Auſtin ſays it is ſo, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo it is;</hi> or <hi>Auſtin ſaith it is not ſo, therefore it is not ſo:</hi> My antecedents I may chance to prove, if I have ſuch an Edition of <hi>Auſtin</hi> by me, as is liable to no exception; but my arguments to be ſure would be denied, and how ſhall I prove them, by asking him whether he account himſelf wiſer than <hi>Auſtin?</hi> he will, if he be wiſe, ask me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I will ſubſcribe to every thing that he can bring a place of <hi>Auſtin</hi> for? and I, if I be not a fool, ſhall not promiſe ſo to do; ſo is our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at an end. But perhaps if I had argued from conſent of Fathers, then he muſt when I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: ſuch conſent, have yielded to me, or elſe he might juſtly be reputed contentious and ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited. I muſt needs acknowledg that the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of many Fathers to a point, is more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than the teſtimony of any one Father to the ſame point. And yet ſometimes one may ſo pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe upon many, that thoſe many who join with him, may juſtly be reputed to ſignifie no more than himſelf alone, or rather not ſo much as himſelf alone; for he that goes about to trapan others into a conſent with him, may well be thought not to be himſelf; there may be a good appeal from a man engaged to make a party, and carry on a deſign, to the ſame man under no ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. Sometimes alſo it is too too apparent, that after one Father had written his opinion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a matter, others have choſen rather to follow him, than to be at the pains to enquire whether he
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:105061:88"/>was to be followed. But be this as it will: when is it we may reckon our ſelves to have the conſent of Fathers? I ſuppoſe when we hold that which all or the moſt of the Fathers did hold manifeſtly, frequently, conſtantly, no others contradicting them. If ſuch a conſent as this be not almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be had in the queſtions now diſputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians, then muſt I needs confeſs my ſelf much miſtaken in the collections I have made out of the Writings of the Fathers. But it will be good for the further clearing of this buſineſs, to inſtance in particulars, that we may know how much we are bound to follow Fathers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There be ſome matters purely philoſophical; how much is to be attributed to the conſent of the Fathers in theſe? Muſt we concern our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come to be of any opinion about them, to enquire what their ſentiments concerning them were? Had the Fathers ſuch clear conceptions in Phyſicks, Metaphyſicks, Mathematicks, that he who departs from them, muſt needs be thought to be in an error? If ſo, I know no Sect of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers that muſt not be judged to abound with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> tells us, that <hi>Baſil, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret, Nazianzen,</hi> did all hold that Light was created by God out of any ſubject, and thence notes againſt Hereticks, <hi>That accidents can in the Euchariſt exiſt without a ſubject.</hi> As for <hi>Baſil,</hi> I think notwithſtanding all the pains <hi>Bellarmine</hi> takes <hi>De Euch. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. to make him of that opinion, he is well enough brought off by <hi>Scultetus. Theodoret</hi> I have not by me, and will not gueſs what
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105061:89"/>his mind was. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> in his 43. <hi>Orat.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. hath theſe words concerning that Light, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſome of which words ſound ſuſpiciouſly, yet perhaps do not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily infer, that he conceived Light to be a quality exiſting without a ſubject; if they do, he ſaith plainly it was but his own private opinion. But now ſuppoſe all theſe three, and three and twenty more Fathers had been of this mind, muſt I be thought proud if I did not forthwith allow the poſſibility of an accident's ſubſiſting without a ſubject? If I muſt, <hi>jacta eſt alea,</hi> I am reſolved in all ſuch caſes not to purchaſe a reputation of humility by diſclaiming my reaſon. <hi>Lactantius</hi> and <hi>Auſtin</hi> do with ſome zeal oppoſe the <hi>Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> and laugh at the aſſertors of them. Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> treads in their ſteps. As for Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> who got into the Chair about the year 750. his zeal againſt the <hi>Antipodes</hi> was ſo furious, that nothing Ieſs would ſatisfie it, than the condemning of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius,</hi> a Biſhop in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> as an Heretick, becauſe he adventured to aſſert, that there were men whoſe feet were oppoſite to ours. <hi>Fromund</hi> in his <hi>Anti-ariſtarchus</hi> is troubled at this ſtory, and takes ſome pains to qualifie it ſo, as that it may not derogate from the Popes infallibility.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not be offended with any man that can prove there never was a Pope who thought it he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie to hold the Earth to be round. And I am glad the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now-a-days allows her follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers more liberty in matters of Philoſophy, than
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:105061:89"/>formerly; for the more liberty is allowed to men of that perſwaſion, though but in Philoſophy, the more hopes may we conceive of their coming over to us.</p>
            <p>But I ſee plainly that the ancient Fathers did look upon the roundneſs of the Earth as a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox; and it is not many years ſince a Divine in <hi>England</hi> writing againſt the morality of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, laid down abundance of propoſitions which were every one of them falſe, the plainneſs of the earth not being ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>However, I am reſolved to adhere to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and hiſtory, ſay the Fathers and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers what they will to the contrary. To be ſhort, ſo far as I can judg, the Fathers were not the beſt Philoſophers that ever the world enjoyed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is to be attributed to the conſent of Fathers in matters of Chronology? Surely not very much: for being generally unacquainted with the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and following none of the beſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> they miſerably failed in the Age of the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> Patriarchs. All good men can eaſily pardon that their error; ſome of late have gone about to juſtifie their account, but upon ſuch weak grounds, that I ſhould much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if among Scholars they ſhould have many fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. The Learned world will not eaſily yield that all the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies we now uſe, are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. and to be amended by the <hi>Septuagint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. What is to be attributed to the Fathers in matters Hiſtorical? To anſwer this it would be enquired, 1. How far they thought themſelves concerned to report truth. 2. Of what prudence
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:105061:90"/>they were. For if any of them thought an offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lye lawful, there is no relying upon the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry written by him; and that none of the Fathers thought an officious lye lawful, I am not he that will affirm; I rather fear that ſome of them did make no ſcruple to uſe pious frauds, the more to ſet off Chriſtian Religion to thoſe Heathens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom they did write. He that hath any noſe may ſmell ſomething of this officiouſneſs in ſundry of thoſe miracles that are left on record by Eccleſiaſtical Writers. 2. If any of them did think that they might not lye, no not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; yet if they were credulous, and apt to be abuſed by cunning men, they might report things far from truth, which yet upon their credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation would be taken for true in ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations. What an incredible ſtory doth <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in his Exhortation to the <hi>Greeks</hi> tell us, concerning the 72. Interpreters, <hi>viz.</hi> That the King who ſent for them, appointed them to be kept in diſtinct Cells, not ſuffering them to ſpeak with one another, and yet that their interpretation at laſt was ſound not only to agree in ſenſe, but in every word.

And yet <hi>Philo</hi> makes no mention of theſe Cells into which they were ſeverally put; and <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſpeaks of their conferring together, as <hi>Ariſtaeas</hi> had done before him.

            <p n="4">4. What is to be attributed to the Fathers in expounding of Scripture? Muſt we not take that to be the true ſenſe of a Text, which they have generally pitched upon? <hi>Anſ.</hi> To find out the true ſenſe and meaning of the Spirit of God in any Text not very obvious, in an ordinary way 'tis neceſſary that a man ſhould have a good skill in Logick, ſo as to be able to analyſe well; and that he ſhould be well ſeen in thoſe Languages in which the inſpired Penmen did write. As for knowledg in Logick, the moſt of the Fathers did not abound in that; I could inſtance in one Modern Logician, from whom a Scholar may have more help for ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſing Scripture, than from all the Fathers put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And for skill in the Oriental Languages, every one will acknowledge that moſt of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had but little. <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>Hebrew,</hi> ſo did few of the Ancients be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; and it will be no diſparagement to <hi>Origen</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:105061:91"/>or <hi>Hierome</hi> to ſay, that there are hundreds in the world at preſent that underſtand that Language far better than either of them ever did, or were in any near capacity to do.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers muſt needs be ſuppoſed well to underſtand the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue in which the whole New Teſtament was written; but ſo did very few of the <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers. I will not ſay who it was that derived <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> from <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. So groſs ignorance do not all the <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers bewray; but they who have <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries by them, will find quickly that the Fathers of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church are not the beſt guides to follow in interpreting Scripture. One Expoſition of <hi>Auſtin</hi> not taken notice of by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus,</hi> I will here mention. The Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. <hi>that boaſting is excluded;</hi> that is, hath no place; but that Learned Father finding the word <hi>excluſa,</hi> runs away with it till he hath quite loſt the Apoſtles ſenſe, <hi>Excluſa, non ut abſcederet pulſa, ſed ut emineret expreſſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. What is to be attributed to the Fathers in matters of Doctrine or Faith? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I ſhall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily grant that to be no fundamental Doctrine or Article of Faith which is denied by many Fathers. 2. If I find any doctrine pretty unanimouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by Fathers, though I ſee no foundation for it in Scripture, I ſhall not think my ſelf concerned to oppoſe that doctrine, till I find ſomething in Scripture that it contradicts. But I am alſo certain, that moſt of the Fathers (that I ſay not all) had their errors, and ſome of them ſo groſs, that he who ſhould now hold them, would ſcarce be
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:105061:91"/>thought meet to be a Church-officer. Therefore I am reſolved to ſtudy Scripture with care and conſcience, and on that to build my faith. In ſo doing I ſhall be ſure to obey my Saviours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; and I may promiſe my ſelf the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, whoſe office it is to lead me into all truth. And if thoſe doctrines that I have good aſſurance be grounded on Scripture, be charged with novelty and ſingularity, then ſhall I rejoice if I can find the Fathers conſenting with me. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good ends I can propound to my ſelf in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Fathers; but the main end I aim at, is to ſtop the mouth of gainſayers, eſpecially thoſe who glory in Antiquity, and make conſent of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers their rule. I will not reject any truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is but newly diſcovered, nor yet embrace any error becauſe it is of long continuance, or becauſe ſome great and good man had the ill hap to be the firſt Author of it. Never ſhall any <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> have occaſion to ſay of me, as I find it by one of that Sect objected to the Reformed, <hi>Scripturam ſacram ex illorum (Patrum Concilio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum<expan>

Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal names are uſed properly in the Myſtery of the Trinity; the word, according to <hi>Origen,</hi> is not uſed properly, but metaphorically, <hi>ergo</hi> it is not a perſonal name. Becauſe the minor could not be denied, <hi>Origen</hi> muſt be accounted the fountain of <hi>Arianiſm.</hi> Firſt, the whole perhaps would be
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:105061:93"/>granted by <hi>Durand,</hi> who ſaith that the title of <hi>[Word]</hi> properly imports ſomething eſſential and not perſonal. I think the Scriptures (which in ſpeaking of this Myſtery I would follow) alway appropriate the title of <hi>Word</hi> to the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but that he is called the <hi>Word</hi> properly and not metaphorically only, I cannot as yet find in Scripture. I believe according to Scripture, that the Father begat the Son, but that he begat him as affected with an act of underſtanding, not as underſtanding is common to all the three perſons, but as he hath it from himſelf, is not I hope a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Article of Faith; if it be, I have not all the faith that is neceſſary to ſalvation. Nor can I obtain of my ſelf to think, that the Son of God is any otherways called the <hi>Word,</hi> than becauſe he reſembleth that either Oral or Mental Word that is formed by us men. And were it not that the general ſtream of Interpreters carrieth the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to a Mental Word, I ſhould be eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe, that as a vocal word ſerves to diſcloſe the mind of a man, ſo Chriſt is called the Word, becauſe he diſcovereth the Myſterious Will and Counſel of God.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Origen</hi> did not lay the foundation of <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> much leſs can the <hi>Photinians</hi> (whom the <hi>Socinians</hi> now follow) pretend to be his off-ſpring, for they denied Chriſt to have any being before he was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt in the womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> differing from the <hi>Ebionites</hi> only in this, that they did not hold him to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as well as born of <hi>Mary.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niebus</hi> is ſo ingenuous, as to confeſs

The truth is, we need not be afraid leſt our young Divines ſhould grow <hi>Socinians</hi> by reading the Fathers, or thoſe who profeſs themſelves to be <hi>Socinians,</hi> the great danger is from <hi>Eraſmus</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> who never profeſſed <hi>Socinianiſm;</hi> but yet in their Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, eſpecially on the Epiſtles, do moſt unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the various readings which they have, as they pretend, met with, or ſome plauſible expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their own, endeavour to enervate the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are brought to prove the Deity of Chriſt Jeſus.

If this be allowable to forſake the <hi>Greek,</hi> where the vulgar <hi>Latin, Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from it, how ſhall we know where to fix our feet? And let the Learned judg, whether the <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Tranſlations that we have in the <hi>Polyglott,</hi> did read, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: if they did, thoſe who tranſlated them are much to be blamed. It is alſo untruly ſuggeſted, that <hi>Hincmarus</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was put in by the <hi>Neſtorians:</hi> But if <hi>Hinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus</hi> had ſo ſaid, <hi>Grotius</hi> might, if he had ſo pleaſed, have acquainted his Reader, that <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> read <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, who was older than <hi>Neſtorius</hi> himſelf: And he could alſo have told us, that <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> made uſe of this reading, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, againſt <hi>Neſtorius;</hi> and therefore ſure neither he nor his followers did firſt frame this reading, which is ſo perfectly deſtructive to their hereſie. Another place we bring to prove Chriſts Deity, is, Rom. 9.5. <hi>Mirum eſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Praef. ad libros de Chriſto) quid non agat</hi> Eraſmus, <hi>quò ſe non vertat, quid non moliatur ut hoc telum de manibus nobis extorqueat. Eraſmus</hi> doth indeed take two much pains to make this place uſeleſs againſt the <hi>Arians;</hi> yet which ſhould have aſſwaged <hi>Bellarmines</hi> wrath, he adds like a good Son of the Church, that if ſhe ſay we muſt not
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:105061:95"/>interpret theſe words, but of the Divinity of Chriſt, ſhe is to be obeyed. As for <hi>Grotius,</hi> he firſt tells us, that it is manifeſt from the <hi>Syriack,</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was wanting in the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Copies. There is not a <hi>Greek</hi> Copy of any note now extant, in which the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> occurs not; and yet if the <hi>Syriack</hi> expreſs it not, then it muſt be thought it was abſent from the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Copies: what will ſuch an opinion as this lead us to? Secondly, he refers us to <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> who hath noted, that the words are read without <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the ancient Books of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Hilary;</hi> and that St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſeems to have read ſo too. But <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſpeaks not of the ancient Books of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in which, or ſundry of which, the word <hi>Deus</hi> is to be found; and <hi>Grotius</hi> could not but know that thoſe Copies of <hi>Cyprian</hi> muſt needs be corrupted in which <hi>Deus</hi> is wanting; for no Scripture, but that in which Chriſt is called God, could ſerve <hi>Cyprians</hi> turn in that place, as any Reader may diſcern. <hi>Hilary</hi> left not out the word <hi>Deus,</hi> but his Scribe, as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> almoſt acknowledgeth, and <hi>Hilary,</hi> to be ſure, in his Books, <hi>de Trinitate,</hi> citeth this place with the word <hi>Deus. Chryſoſtom,</hi> indeed, doth not expound <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, nor yet doth he expound <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; but he reads juſt as we read. By this we may ſee how little zeal <hi>Grotius</hi> had for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Chriſt, and what danger they are in, who will take his quotations in his Annotations upon truſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In this number I muſt needs place the <hi>Papiſts</hi> properly and ſtrictly ſo called. A <hi>Papiſt</hi> ſtrictly and properly ſo called, is with me not one who
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:105061:95"/>holds the moſt of thoſe doctrines which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church holds; but he who holds them ſolely or principally on the account of the preſent Churches Infallibility: More particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I do not ſay he is a <hi>Papiſt</hi> who holds <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi> becauſe as he thinks the Scripture teacheth it; but he who therefore believes the Scripture to teach <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> becauſe the Pope in or out of a Council hath decreed or warranted the ſame. Should I deny the Popes Infallibility in a cauſe of faith, I were to a <hi>Trent-Papiſt</hi> a Heretick, as well as if I denied all the Articles of the faith, becauſe I deny the formal reaſon upon which all are to be believed. Should I hold the Popes Infallibility as the ground and foundation of my faith, then I were to him a good Catholick, though I were miſtaken in many of the things to be believed, becauſe I am upon the true and ſure foundation of faith. Now if any one can ſhew me any whole ancient Church, or any one ancient Doctor of the Church who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Article of the Biſhop of <hi>Romes</hi> Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Supremacy, and made that the ground of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving all other Articles, I will be his Convert, if he will promiſe to be my Convert provided I can ſhew him ancient Doctors and Councils that have either not acknowledged or denied this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Papal faith. And if we ſpeak of the things believed by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the moſt of them are utterly deſtitute of all primitive Antiquity.</p>
            <p>But there are others in the world generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried as deſpiſers of the Fathers, who had they but men among them able and willing to ſearch the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:105061:96"/>Fathers, might from them ſay more for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than would eaſily be anſwered. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> or <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts,</hi> (as they had rather be called) ſome of great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem among the ſons of the Church, have ſaid that the opinion of theſe men cannot be confuted by Scripture, at leaſt not by Scripture alone. In this they give theſe men as much as the generality of them deſire or care for. But of late one of good learning hath eſpouſed their Cauſe; and finding it granted by too too many, that Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm cannot with ſufficient evidence be proved from Scripture alone; he enquires what it is that together with Scripture will prove it? Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Ancients, he there joins iſſue, and hath ſo acquitted himſelf, that for my part if I were not perſwaded from Scripture that Infants are to be baptized, I ſhould hardly be brought to be of that perſwaſion by any thing quoted from the Fathers.</p>
            <p>One deſervedly dignified in the Church, hath ſuffered it to be printed as his opinion, <hi>that there is neither precept nor practice in Scripture for Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm, nor any juſt evidence for it for about two hundred years after Chriſt. The firſt who bears witneſs to Infant-baptiſm practiſed in the Church, is</hi> Tertullian; <hi>but ſo, as he expreſly diſlikes and condemns it as an unwarrantable and irrational cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome; and</hi> Nazianzen <hi>a good while after him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes it too,</hi> &amp;c. with much more of that nature. Really were I of this learned perſons judgment, that there is neither precept nor practice in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:105061:96"/>for <hi>Paedobaptiſm,</hi> I ſhould much haeſitate in the matter: for if there be no precept or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Paedobaptiſm</hi> in Scriptures, I ask whether the Church ſucceeding the Apoſtles had any reaſon or authority to take up that cuſtom? if ſhe had, then the preſent Church alſo hath authority to take it up, though it had never before been taken up; for the Church hath now the ſame authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that the Church ſucceeding the Apoſtolical times had. It will be ſaid, that the Church ſucceeding immediately to the Apoſtles, had better oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to know the practice of the Apoſtles, than the preſent Church hath. <hi>Anſ.</hi> That muſt needs be granted; and if the Church ſucceeding the Apoſtles have given any undoubted teſtimony that the Apoſtolical Churches practiſed Infant-baptiſm, her teſtimony cannot be refuſed; but that that Church hath given any ſuch teſtimony, is eaſie to ſay, but not ſo eaſie to prove. Nothing out of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> or <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> is produced to ſuch a purpoſe. The Author of the Queſtions and Anſwers to the Orthodox, doth indeed, <hi>qu.</hi> 56. plainly inſinuate, that in his time <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> were baptized, and gives ſome account what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſhould be in the reſurrection, betwixt thoſe who were baptized, and thoſe who were not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and of the reaſon why the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy of Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: And were this Author <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> the teſtimony were conſiderable, not to prove that Infant-baptiſm was practiſed in the time of the Apoſtles, but that Infant-baptiſm was ſoon pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed; but the Author of thoſe Queſtions and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105061:97"/>Anſwers muſt needs be ſome one that lived long after <hi>Juſtin Martyr. Origen</hi> I believe will be found to be the firſt that ſpeaks of Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm as an Apoſtolical tradition, in his Com. on <hi>Rom.</hi> But the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſt</hi> to him and all others may ſay, It is manifeſt from the Ancients, that divers children of Chriſtian Parents were not baptized in their infancy, nor till they were come to maturity of judgment; and that it was accounted no <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, no bar to their preferment that their Baptiſm was ſo long deferred, that they were not before their baptiſm looked upon as unclean: now if this be ſo, how cometh it to paſs that in a Church profeſſing to follow and reverence Antiquity, they are excommunicated and thrown into priſon if they do not bring their children to be baptized. Let any man prove out of Antiquity, that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> and his father were accounted Heathens and Publicans till the Son was baptized, which was not till he was about thirty years old.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I hear there are ſundry among us here in <hi>England,</hi> that refuſe to take an oath, judging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny oath unlawful in Goſpel-times. The opinion of theſe men is very pernicious, manifeſtly tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perpetuate ſtrifes and contentions, which cannot in our Courts of Judicature be ended but by an oath; and I doubt not at all, but that the opinion may be clearly refuted out of Scripture, where the preſent Patrons of it eſpecially ſeek to ſhelter themſelves: but if from the Scriptures we remove their Cauſe to the Fathers, among them I doubt they will find more friends than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:105061:97"/>For that an Oath is not, at leaſt in any ſecular matter, to be required or taken, ſeems clearly to have been the opinion of <hi>Athanaſius, Nazianzen, Chryſoſtom, Iſidore Peleuſiota, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact, Hilary, Ambroſe, Hierom;</hi> and I think, to the <hi>Greek.</hi> Fathers I might have added <hi>Baſil.</hi> Artifices I know are uſed to evade their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but ſuch as will not hold when they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by thoſe who can underſtand the languages in which thoſe ancient Doctors did write.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Men uſually exclaim againſt the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as perſons who forſake all antiquity to follow <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> who is but of yeſterday; and I think, if any of them ſay that <hi>Calvin</hi> affords a ſtudent more light to underſtand Scripture than moſt of the Fathers put together, they are not much to be blamed. But I muſt needs ſay, that <hi>Presbyterians</hi> is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a term that I underſtand not; every Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt who is not Congregational, is in ſome mens mouths a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> though he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared any diſlike of <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> yea, though he vehemently proteſt that his judgment is for <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy,</hi> even for all and every part of Primitive <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi> In Dr. <hi>Heylins</hi> late Hiſtory of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,</hi> a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> is ſometimes one that would have the Lords day obſerved as a Sabbath, one that thinks election and <hi>non</hi> election to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute; and if a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> be ſuch a one, ſure it would be no difficult task to prove that there were ſuch men in the world long before <hi>Culvins</hi> name was ever heard of. With other m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> is the ſame with the old Non confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, and againſt ſuch a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> it is that Mr.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:105061:98"/>
               <hi>Scrivener</hi> ſeems to have laid his action; but beſides that he hath laid his Action <hi>coram non Judice,</hi> I think, that when the merits of the cauſe come to be examined, he will quickly be <hi>non</hi>-ſuited: For it will be impoſſible for him to prove either that ſuch a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> is a Schiſmatick, or that if he be a Schiſmatick, his Schiſm is novel. The old Non-conformiſt was one that could not think a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to be by Divine inſtitution, an Officer of a ſuperior Order to a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> ſole power of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction and Ordination was the block he could never get over. In matter of worſhip, he could not ſatisfie himſelf to practiſe the Ceremonies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and preſcribed in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> That the Miniſters ordained in <hi>England</hi> were not true Miniſters, or that they might not be ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to as ſuch, he never thought. He could and did give, and receive the Sacrament, only ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he both Preached and Adminiſtred the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in private, to ſuch as were of his own opinion and perſwaſion. If every ſuch man muſt be accounted an Arian and a Schiſmatick, he may comfort himſelf in this, that he hath many among the Ancients, who if they had lived in theſe days, muſt needs have been called by the ſame name. If ſuch a one decline tryal by the Fathers, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe he hath not had the good hap to read the Fathers, or becauſe he foreſees the tryal will be too tedious and chargeable, and might ſooner be ended, if only Scripture were made the Rule. Mr. <hi>Scrivener</hi> is not ſure ſuch a ſtranger in our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as not to know how hard the <hi>Dioceſans</hi> are put to it, when the Fathers are brought againſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:105061:98"/>them. He can tell, no doubt, who they be that are wont to call St. <hi>Hierom</hi> a diſcontented <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> a Popular Biſhop. He knows who they be, that have undertaken to ruine <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Epiſcopacy</hi> by <hi>Clement</hi> and <hi>Ignatius.</hi> And it is poſſible he hath heard of thoſe, who did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to overthrow our Engliſh Hierarchy, by Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> diſſertations for <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi> He knows, that when two were appointed to diſpute againſt Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> in the five points, the Dr. preſently divided, and ſet them at variance betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and cannot chuſe but think it very eaſie for the preſent Non-conformiſts, if they were brought to a conference with the Prelatical, to make them do execution one upon another.</p>
            <p>To deal a little more cloſely with Mr. <hi>Scrivener,</hi> he hath in the name of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and his own, laid an action againſt a Novel Schiſm: If the Non-conformiſts upon ſummons made, ſhall think meet to appear to this Action, doubtleſs they will plead not guilty; they will not confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty of cauſing any new ſchiſm, but will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verr, that they proceed upon the ſame Principles, that were laid down by the great inſtruments of our reformation here in <hi>England.</hi> It will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that they oppugne Biſhops, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn in the words of Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet, Iren. p.</hi> 385. <q>That they doubt not to make it evident that the main ground for ſetling Epiſcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Nation, was not accounted any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Divine right, but the convenience of that form of Church government, to the ſtate and condition of this Church, at the time of its
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:105061:99"/>Reformation;</q> and that they for their parts were never asked whether Epiſcopal government was ſuitable to the condition of this Church when it was at firſt reformed; but whether it be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Divine Right. Now to anſwer them here, the words of the declaration they are to make muſt be ſcanned, and the particulars of thoſe Books they are to aſſent and conſent to muſt be ſearched; if from them it do appear, that he who doth without quillets declare aſſent and conſent, muſt receive Biſhops as an higher order of Officers than Presbyters, and that by Chriſts inſtitution, how will they be found guilty of Novelliſm or Schiſm, unleſs <hi>Wickliff</hi> and <hi>Cranmer, &amp;c.</hi> be found guilty alſo? But perhaps it will go harder with them in the matter of Ceremonies. Really it will, and if for theſe they ſeparate from the Church, I am content they be caſt; for certainly it is againſt the whole rule of charity and humility to break off communion in all Ordinances, becauſe ſome one Ordinance is adminiſtred with ſome ſuch ceremony as I account inexpedient or unlawful. If any Church make the approving of the expedience or lawfulneſs of that Ceremony, a neceſſary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my holding communion with her, then ſhe, and not I cauſeth the Schiſm. But to ſpeak to the matter in iſſue. The preſent Non-conformiſts are not the firſt that ſcrupled the uſe of the Engliſh Ceremonies. Sundry of thoſe who were martyred in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days would never be brought to uſe them, moſt of thoſe who then fled into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign parts both in their exile, and at their return, either durſt not, or did not care to uſe them.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:105061:99"/>Some of them for Non-conformity refuſed prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome were turned out of that they had, ſome took up with very ſmall preferment, where no eye could envy them. I have ſometimes thought upon it, who they were, that in Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> Reign did the Church moſt ſervice in diſputing and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the Papiſts, and I find them to have been ſuch, as either did not conform, or conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heavily and by halves. I have heard it cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured as an error in policy, for a Court not to regard thoſe in a time of peace, whom they were forced to make uſe of in a time of war. Let Mr. <hi>Scrivener</hi> conſider whether the Conformiſts have ſtrength and number ſufficient to look the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and other adverſaries in the face, unleſs they take in the Non-conformiſts; if they have not, is it prudence, to be at odds with thoſe that muſt joyn with them in the day of Battel? If he ſay they have number and ſtrength enough, let him then conſider whether it may not be, that ſome of them will prove falſe and treacherous, or at leaſt, make a diſhonourable peace. I could here ſhew that ſundry of them, who moſt rigorouſly preſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days, did in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> days either recant, or play the Nicodemites. But this is a performance that I have no mind to be put upon; how ſoon ſome other may put himſelf upon it I cannot tell.</p>
            <p>Here I might with credit enough take my leave of Mr. <hi>Scrivener;</hi> yet becauſe there be two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in his Book, that have not in theſe Papers been accounted for, I will, before I conclude, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay whether the Non-conformiſts cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:105061:100"/>therefrom. The firſt is the <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> Conference: The ſecond is the matter of Ruling Elders: About both Mr. <hi>Scrivener</hi> is full of confidence and triumph. If a good account can be given of theſe, I may think the reproach to be rolled away from the <hi>Nonconformiſts;</hi> for as for railing invectives againſt particular perſons, I need only ſay, <hi>Lord lay them not to his charge.</hi>

This ſorrow of the Doctor is I know denied by many, by none more than by Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Hickman:</hi> but I have enough to clear Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inventor, or feigner of that ſtory; for he had it from Mr. <hi>Noel Sparkes,</hi> a learned and pious Divine, and of the Epiſcopal perſwaſion, who died but few years before his Majeſties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, by him he was allowed to put it in print, as told him by one who would not on ſlight grounds either raiſe or receive a report againſt a Biſhop, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry Jackson,</hi> ſometime fellow of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> Colledg in <hi>Oxford.</hi> That all this is true, Mr. <hi>John Martin,</hi> now a Conforming Miniſter in the Dioceſs of <hi>Hereford,</hi> can, and if asked will, I ſuppoſe, witneſs.</p>

If the Conference ſhould he truly reported, little or no damage could thence accrue to the Nonconformiſts; for as is ſaid in the Chriſtian and Modeſt offer of a moſt indifferent Conference or Diſputation printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1606. pag. 29, 30. <hi>Moſt of the perſons appointed to ſpeak for the Miniſters, were not of their chuſing nor nomination, nor of their judgment in the matters then and now in queſtion,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:105061:101"/>but of a clean contrary. For being intreated at that time by the Miniſters to diſpute againſt theſe things as ſimply evil, and ſuch as cannot be yielded unto without ſin; they profeſſed unto them, that they were not ſo perſwaded, and therefore could not ſo do. Being then requeſted to let his Majeſty underſtand, that ſome of their brethren were further perſwaded touching the unlawfulneſs of theſe things, than they themſelves were; they refuſed that alſo. Laſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intreated either to give them in writing their reaſons to prove theſe things indifferent, or to give them an anſwer in writing to ſuch reaſons as they would give them in writing to prove them ſimply evil; they would do neither the one nor the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Will <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> then loſe ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a perſon as Dr. <hi>Reynolds?</hi> and are they content the world ſhould look upon him as no <hi>Nonconformiſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No doubt he was one that was loth to be made unuſeful in the Church, and loth that others ſhould make themſelves unuſeful; and therefore when any Miniſter profeſſing himſelf diſſatisfied with Subſcription, came to ask his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he would (as I have been credibily inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) deſire him to give him the grounds of his diſſatisfaction, and if he found them weighty, then he would leave him ſetled in his Nonconformity; but if he found them not weighty, then he would let him know that thoſe reaſons notwithſtanding he might conform. As for himſelf, he was ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to do all that was incumbent on him, as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:105061:101"/>of the Colledg, but thought our Church needed a further Reformation, and that the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies were unprofitable; and prayed that in a due and orderly manner they might be taken away: yet would not peremptorily ſay, that a man ſhould loſe his Miniſtry rather than not uſe them. And of this mind were moſt of thoſe who had in thoſe times the honour to be called and accounted <hi>Puritans.</hi> And let me here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it ſeriouſly to the conſideration of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> whether it be not poſſible for them to be over zealous in preſſing others not to conform. Sure I am, that the learned and godly Mr. <hi>Anthony Wotton</hi> did flatly deny to tell Mr. <hi>VVill. Brice</hi> ſtill alive, the grounds and reaſons of his Non conformity, telling him, <hi>That he would not in ſuch matters put ſcruples into thoſe in whom he found none.</hi> And really, may not a Conformiſt ſave his own ſoul, and the ſouls of thoſe that hear him? may he not keep his eyes open, and yet not have light enough to ſee the unlawfulneſs of our Ceremonies? If ſo, as doubtleſs ſo it is, why ſhould Non-conformiſts think ſo ill, as ſome do, of their conforming brethren? why ſhould they be ſo reſtleſs, till they have made them their proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes? why may they not acknowledg and rejoyce in their gifts and graces, and yet peaceably perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in their own Non-conformity, only wiping off the aſperſions that are thrown on themſelves, and candidly repreſenting their principles, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, that ſo the preſent and ſucceeding ages may ſee, they do not ſuffer out of humour and fancy; and that they err not (if they be in an error) without authority and reaſon.</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:105061:102"/>
               <p n="3">3. If we ſhould grant that the publiſhed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference were in all things true and impartial, yet have the friends of Epiſcopacy, and ſticklers for conformity, but little reaſon to boaſt or triumph. This muſt be made out by ſome brief reflections upon the conference.</p>
               <p>The firſt day none of thoſe who deſired Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, were permitted to be preſent at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, nor indeed all that were ſummoned to appear as defenders of the then eſtabliſhed do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and diſcipline, but only the Biſhops and five Deans; why neither the Dean of <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> nor the Dean of <hi>VVorceſter,</hi> nor the Dean of <hi>Windſor</hi> were admitted, nor yet Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> nor Dr. <hi>King,</hi> I find no reaſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned; nor will I gueſs, at ſo great a diſtance, what might be the reaſon: but why none of the Plaintiffs (as they are called) were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, His Majeſty gave this reaſon, <hi>That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops might not be confronted by the contrary op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents; and that if any thing ſhould be found meet to be redreſſed, it might be done without any viſible alteration.</hi> I ſuppoſe King <hi>James</hi> thought the things he mentioned in that days Conference, were too too liable to exception, and was reſolved to take courſe with his Biſhops and their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to have ſome little amendment, that if they ſhould happen to be mentioned in the next days deſigned Conference, they might anſwer they had already conſidered them, and would have no more done or ſaid about them.</p>
               <p>The particulars of that Cabal-Conference, are ſaid to be touching the Common-prayer-book,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:105061:102"/>Excommunication, providing of fit and able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for <hi>Ireland.</hi> How the providing of fit and able Miniſters for <hi>Ireland,</hi> could be proper for this days Conference, I underſtand not. Dr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> ſaith, p. 9. it was referred to a conſultation; if ſo, and that conſultation produced any good effect, all good Chriſtians are to rejoyce, for doubtleſs that Nation then wanted Miniſters. But the Millenary Petition pretended to be the occaſion of this Conference, toucheth not upon <hi>Ireland;</hi> if any thing was meet to be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that Church, in this Conference, reaſon ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther required that the Council for <hi>Ireland</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Biſhops ſhould have been ſummoned to debate and conclude concerning that affair. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Doctor miſtook <hi>Ireland</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> or was willing to have us believe that there was no want of a Learned Miniſtry here in <hi>England;</hi> but we ſhall hear more of this in the ſecond days Conference.</p>
               <p>As to the Common-prayer Book, the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſatisfaction about Confirmation, Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Private Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Confirmation we ſhall find mentioned in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond days conference, and thither I refer my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations concerning it.</p>
               <p>Abſolution, His Majeſty ſaid, he had <hi>heard likened to the Popes Pardons;</hi> If any one had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed His Majeſty, that Abſolution as uſed, or at leaſt, as preſcribed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> had any thing in it reſembling the abominable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons of the Pope, I know not how he can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from bearing falſe witneſs againſt the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:105061:103"/>The <hi>Millenarian</hi> Petitioners only pray, that the term <hi>Abſolution,</hi> might be corrected, which His Majeſty was willing to gratifie them in, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing <hi>Abſolution</hi> to be explained by <hi>remiſſion of ſins.</hi> There is, that I know, no real difference betwixt thoſe that are called <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and Epiſcopal Divines about <hi>Abſolution:</hi> Both allow a general Abſolution, and a particular Abſolution. Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> chargeth Bp. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher, with utterly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, as well the Doctrine of the Engliſh Church, as her purpoſe in abſolution; but from that charge, the Primate is acquitted by his Chaplain Dr.</hi> Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</p>
               <p>Baptiſm, King <hi>James</hi> thought, <hi>was not to be adminiſtred by private perſons, in any caſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;</hi> and therefore propounded it to the Biſhops, that the words in the Book purporting a permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſuffering of women and private perſons to baptize, might be altered: And here it is pretty, or rather ſad, to obſerve how the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates contradicted one another; <hi>Whitgift</hi> ſaid, <q>The adminiſtration of Baptiſm by women or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, was not allowed in the practice of our Church, but enquired of by Biſhops in their Viſitation, and cenſured, and that the words in the Book did not infer any ſuch meaning, as that they were permitted to Baptiſe:</q> But the words of the Book being preſſed by His Majeſty, <q>Bp. <hi>Babington</hi> confeſſed that the words were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and might be preſſed to ſuch a meaning; but yet it ſeemed by the contrary practice of the Church (cenſuring women in this caſe) that the Compilers of the Book did not ſo intend them,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:105061:103"/>and yet propounded them ambiguouſly, becauſe otherwiſe, perhaps, the Book would not then have paſſed in Parliament.</q> But on the contrary, Bp. <hi>Bancroft</hi> for his part declared, <hi>That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers of the Book of Common Prayer, intended not by ambiguous terms to deceive any; but did indeed, by thoſe words, intend a permiſſion of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to Baptize in caſe of neceſſity, as appeared by their letters, ſome parts whereof he read, declaring that the ſame was agreeable to the practice of the ancient Church, urging to that purpoſe,</hi> Acts 2. <hi>where Three thouſand were baptized in one day, a thing which could not poſſibly, at leaſt probably be done by the Apoſtles alone, and beſides the Apoſtles. there were then no Biſhops nor Prieſts. He alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged</hi> Tertullian <hi>and</hi> Ambroſe <hi>plain in that point.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> alſo ſpake learnedly and earneſtly to the ſame purpoſe, affirming, <hi>that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of private perſons to baptize in caſe of neceſſity, were to croſs all antiquity; and that, it was a rule agreed upon among Divines, That the Miniſter is not of the eſſence of the ſacrament:</hi> But King <hi>James</hi> perſiſting in his opinion to have the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, ſaith the Relator, <hi>pag.</hi> 19. <hi>it was not ſo much ſtuck at by the Biſhops;</hi> it ſeems that to pleaſe His Majeſty, they did not much ſtick to have all antiquity croſſed, and a Rule among Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines over-ruled. Had the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in a point of ſo great moment, ſhewed themſelves ſo facile, what a noiſe would have been made?</p>
               <p>But ſeeing the alteration is made, and Baptiſm reſtrained to Miniſters, we may now without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I hope, enquire what is to be ſaid in this
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:105061:104"/>controverſie, and whether other Churches do well to allow that, which we ſee not meet to allow.</p>
               <p>And firſt, I would know whether Chriſt the confeſſed inſtitutor of Baptiſm, hath any where commanded lay-perſons, in the abſence of thoſe to whom the word of reconciliation is committed, to adminiſter Baptiſm; if he have not, then their not adminiſtring it can be no ſin, becauſe no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of a Law: And how can we think that the party who dies unbaptized ſhall fare the worſe, for not having received that which no one was bound to give him? If it be ſaid he hath laid commandment on lay-perſons, where a Miniſter cannot be had, to Baptize; I deſire to ſee where that command is recorded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I demand whether a lay-perſon, male or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male do ſin in Baptizing? If ſo, no power on earth can authorize him or her to Baptize. If it be ſaid, there is no ſin in the caſe; then again I demand where is the permiſſion of Chriſt granted to him or her? for certainly that muſt needs be ſin, which is not allowed by Chriſt the author of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How can we in faith expect that any lay-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould convey, <hi>rem Sacramenti,</hi> that is, be the Miniſter of Sacramental grace? Is it any where revealed in Scripture that he doth any more than the outward act (which of it ſelf availeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing); if it be not, why might we not as good truſt God that he will ſave the ſick child without the outward act, as think and hope he will regard the outward act, when we cannot be aſſured that any more than the outward act is done?</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:105061:104"/>
               <p>Laſtly, When lay perſons are allowed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Baptiſm, who can ſay to them, <hi>ne plus ultra,</hi> hitherto you have proceeded, but further ye ſhall not proceed, other parts of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial function you may not meddle with?</p>
               <p>But it is ſaid that we have great authorities, and the practice of the Univerſal Church to warrant Baptiſm by lay-perſons in caſe of neceſſity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is confidently affirmed; but he who will not believe every confident affirmation, may find ſome of the Ancients either condemning, or not juſtifying Baptiſm by lay-perſons. As for the inſtance <hi>Acts</hi> 2. of the three thouſand baptized in one day; beſides what is ſaid by K. <hi>James, that the example was extraordinary, and therefore not to be argued from with any ſecurity;</hi> we may ſay further, 1. That there is no conſent that at that time there were no more in the Miniſterial Function beſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es the twelve Apoſtles. Biſhop <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft</hi> indeed affirms, that then there were neither Biſhops nor Prieſts beſides the Apoſtles; but if we ſhould grant him that, there might be Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and according to his principles they might baptize; no need therefore of flying to lay-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; it is not improbable that the Seventy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were then preſent, and who can aſſure us that they had no miniſterial character on them? 2. The Twelve might if they ſaw meet Baptize Three thouſand in one day. 3. It cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that all thoſe ſouls were Baptized in one day: added to the Church they were in one day; but that they were ſolemnly entred into the Church by baptiſm in one day, the Text doth not prove.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:105061:105"/>Perhaps not any one that heard the words of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> gladly, was baptized either the ſame day, or in the ſame place in which he heard; but all went to ſome other places where there was much water, and there were baptized; for that they were baptized in the ſame place where they heard, is not probable, at leaſt not certain.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Is it not a rule agreed upon among Divines, That the Miniſter is not of the eſſence of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The word <hi>Eſſence</hi> is an ambiguous term, and ſo acknowledged to be by Philoſophers; and it is not worth while to diſtinguiſh it, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn anſwer to this queſtion, in diſtinct propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. King <hi>James</hi> anſwered, that <hi>the Miniſter is of the Eſſence of the right and lawful miniſtration of the Sacrament.</hi> Till that anſwer be overthrown, it will not be ſafe to commit the adminiſtration of Baptiſm to lay-hands; nor wiſdom for any man to doubt concerning the ſalvation of his child, becauſe he died unbaptized, when he could get none to baptize him whoſe authority to baptize is not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But will not this bring in rebaptization, ſo much abhorred by the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It cannot bring in rebaptization; for if baptiſm by Laicks be only <hi>nomine tenus</hi> baptiſm, the baptiſm that ſucceeds it, will not be the ſecond, but firſt baptiſm, eſpecially if it be adminiſtred in the conditional form, <hi>Si non ſis baptizatus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:105061:105"/>
               <p>The next point his Majeſty propounded to his Biſhops, related to excommunication in cauſes of leſſer moment; asking, <hi>VVhether the name might not be altered, and yet the ſame cenſure be retained?</hi> Or 2dly, <hi>VVhether in place of it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Coercion equivalent thereunto, might not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and thought of?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Relator ſaith, <hi>This was a thing very eaſily yielded to of all ſides</hi> (and yet there was but one, or at leaſt but two ſides there) <hi>becauſe it hath been long and often deſired, but could not be obtained of her Majeſty, who reſolved ſtill to be</hi> ſemper eadem, <hi>and to alter nothing which ſhe had once ſetled,</hi> pag. 19.</p>
               <p>I am here at a great loſs; for I cannot believe that Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſo much famed for piety and judgment, was ſo reſolved not to alter any thing ſhe had once ſetled, as not to yield ſo much as to the alteration of a name, if ſhe were long and often deſired by her Biſhops. Nor do I find that her Biſhops long and often deſired her, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication for leſſer matters might not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Excommunication, or that inſtead of it ſome other Coercion equivalent thereunto, might be thought on. Nor do I underſtand to what end any ſuch thing ſhould be ſo long and ſo often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. What deſirableneſs is there in this, that men for ſmall matters ſhould be excommunicated, but not under the name of Excommunication? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r that they ſhould not be excommunicated, but ſuffer ſome Coercion equivalent thereunto? Thoſe that fear the Lord, do account no Coercion that man can inflict, equivalent to Excommunication
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:105061:106"/>duly pronounced. As for thoſe who do not fear the Lord, if they ſhould chance to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated for a ſmall matter, they would make but a ſmall matter of Excommunication, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther count it a priviledge to be freed from the trouble of going to the publick aſſemblies. For ſuch, if they ſhould owe 4 <hi>d.</hi> to their Miniſter, and refuſe to pay it, an Attorney may ſooner force them to be juſt, than an Apparitor. All this while I have not touched on the chief ground of my admiration, which is, how it came to paſs (if the thing which his Majeſty propounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Excommunication was ſo eaſily yielded on all ſides) that no alteration enſued thereupon? How comes it to paſs that Excommunication, name and thing, paſſeth upon men in matters of ſmall moment, and no Coercion equivalent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is as yet deviſed in the room of it?</p>
               <p>This is all I have to advertiſe about the firſt days Conference.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond days Conference, omitting all Prefatory Speeches, I take notice, that Dr. <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> reduced all he and his Brethren had to ſay, to four heads: The firſt related to doctrine, praying that the doctrine of the Church might be preſerved in purity, according to Gods word; and to that end, that the Articles concluded 1562. might be explained in places obſcure, and enlarged where ſome things were defective. Particularly, the Dr. moved ſomething about the 16. the 23. the 25. Articles; and being about to move more, the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> cut him off, and kneeling down, prayed the King, <q>that the ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:105061:106"/>might be remembred, <hi>Schiſmatici non ſunt audiendi contra Epiſcopos,</hi> and that if any of the four Plaintiffs had ſubſcribed the Communion-Book, and yet lately exhibited a Petition againſt it, they might be removed and not heard, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Decree of a very ancient Council; providing, that no man ſhould be admitted to ſpeak againſt that whereunto he had formerly ſubſcribed. <hi>3dly,</hi> He put the Dr. and his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates in mind, that the King was very clement, who permitted them to ſpeak contrary to the Statute of 10 <hi>Eliz.</hi> againſt the Liturgy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline eſtabliſhed. Laſtly, He deſired to know the end they aimed at, alledging a place out of Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> affirming, that we ought rather to conform our ſelves in Orders and Ceremonies, to the faſhion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> than of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which poſition he doubted they approved, becauſe contrary to the Orders of the Univerſities, they appeared before His Majeſty in <hi>Turky</hi> Gowns, not in their Scholaſtical habits ſorting to their degrees.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Muſa mihi cauſas memora, quo numine laeſo,</l>
                  <l>— Tantaene animis coeleſtibus irae?</l>
               </q>
               <p>So much wrath at the firſt daſh? when men are ſummoned by the King, and bid by him open their grievances, muſt they as ſoon almoſt as they have opened their mouths, be thus ſchooled and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? are the Articles of our Religion ſo ſacred, that to propound a doubt about them, is no leſs a crime than ſchiſm? May not a man think that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:105061:107"/>the Biſhop feared he ſhould not be able to anſwer the Doctor, who took ſo much care that he might not be put to anſwer him at all? Is this to ſhew forth meekneſs of wiſdom?</p>
               <p>Let us a little reflect on the particulars of this great <hi>Dioceſans</hi> paſſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He would have the ancient Canon remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, <hi>Schiſmatici contra Epiſcopos non ſunt audiendi.</hi> This Canon might have been kept in ſtore, till Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> had been condemned for a Schiſmatick, or till the Biſhops had ſaid ſomething which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted; but ſeeing it is now brought into the field we may be allowed to view it, and ſee what metal it is made of. May not a King ſo much as hear what Schiſmaticks can ſay for themſelves? Muſt it be taken for granted, that Biſhops are not culpable cauſes of the Schiſm that is made in a Church? Such a Canon as this would have done excellent ſervice at the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. So would the other Canon, <hi>That no man ſhould be admitted to ſpeak againſt that whereunto he had formerly ſubſcribed,</hi> have done the Popiſh Biſhops excellent ſervice in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Reign; by it, I ſuppoſe, Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys</hi> mouths might have been quite ſtopped; for I doubt they had ſubſcribed to ſomething they were to ſpeak againſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Statute 10 <hi>Elizabethae</hi> did not make it penal for any man having leave from the King to propound his objections againſt the Liturgy or diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> his <hi>Turky</hi>-Gown was not a Turkiſh habit, nor was his Univerſity habit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:105061:107"/>to the habit of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> nor doth any order of the Univerſity require, that a Doctor ſhould have on his Doctors habit every time he appears before the King. So that all this paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate harangue of words might have been ſpared. It may be we may meet with more reaſon in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to what the Doctor moved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He moved the <hi>6th</hi> Article; <hi>After we have received the Holy Ghoſt we may depart from grace, might be worded ſo, as that it might not ſo much as ſeem to favour the Doctrine of the Saints Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie; and that therefore the words neither totally nor finally might be added.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What replied the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> to this? why, <hi>that too many in theſe days neglecting holineſs of life, preſumed too much of perſiſting in grace, laying all their religion on Predeſtination, If I ſhall be ſaved, I ſhall be ſaved; which he ſaid was contrary to the true doctrine of Predeſtination, wherein we ſhould argue rather</hi> aſcendendo, <hi>than</hi> deſcendendo; <hi>thus, I live in obedience to God, and therefore I truſt God hath elected and predeſtinated me to ſalvation: not thus, which is the uſual courſe, God hath choſen me to life, therefore though I ſin never ſo grievouſly, yet I ſhall not be damned; for whom he loves, he loves to the end.</hi> And then ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Majeſty the doctrine of <hi>England</hi> ouching Predeſtination, <hi>VVe muſt receive Gods promiſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But under favour, theſe words do not contain the doctrine of Predeſtination, but are only a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the abuſe of the doctrine of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation laid down in the foregoing words. As for
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:105061:108"/>thoſe who did uſually argue <hi>deſcendendo,</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they were only men of wretched and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate lives, and we muſt not bauk a truth leſt they ſhould ſtumble at it; or if we muſt, then muſt we alſo forbear to ſay, God is merciful, and Chriſt died for ſinners, leſt men ſhould thence conclude, Therefore I ſhall be ſaved, though I live in many ſins; for ſo it is argued uſually. Wherefore the Biſhop hath ſhewed no reaſon why the Doctor's addition might not be made for the comfort of the trembling penitent; and more full and apert confutation of thoſe who aſſert a total apoſtaſie from grace received. Yet I confeſs Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> needed not to have made this motion, becauſe the ſeventeenth Article clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough aſſerteth perſeverance.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing moved by the Dr. related to the <hi>23d</hi> Article, in which it is ſaid, <hi>That it is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office of preaching or adminiſtring the Sacraments in the Congregation, before he be lawfully called.</hi> What could Dr. <hi>R.</hi> take exception at in this Article? why, ſaith the Relator, at thoſe words, <hi>In the Congregation;</hi> as implying a lawfulneſs for any man whoſoever, out of the Congregation, to preach and adminiſter the Sacraments, though he had no lawful call thereunto. He that can think the Doctor argued at this rate, muſt think he was not the Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> whoſe praiſe is in all the Reformed Churches. I ſhould rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Dr. took exception at the words <hi>in the Congregation;</hi> as not ſufficient to expreſs (what was needful to be expreſſed in all Articles of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:105061:108"/>Religion) that men may not in private preach and adminiſter the Sacraments, though they have no lawful call thereunto. This ſure was the Doctors arguing; but was not to be ſo propounded, leſt it ſhould have been thought neceſſary to ſay more for the perfection of the Churches Articles than could well be ſaid. But ſuppoſing Dr. <hi>R.</hi> to have diſputed as the Relator hath reported, what was anſwered to him? Why, that it was a vain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, <hi>becauſe by the doctrine and practice of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>none but a licenſed Miniſter might Preach, nor either publickly or privately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Euchariſt or the Lords-Supper, pag.</hi> 30, 31. We are not told by whom this was anſwered, if we had, we might have been apt to think they were not the profoundeſt men in the world; for the rejoynder is eaſie, that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> owned another Sacrament beſides the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. Here, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the King muſt be brought in to anſwer for thoſe who were not of one mind to anſwer for themſelves; and what is he ſaid to have anſwered? why, that he had taken order for private baptiſm with the Biſhops already. I ask, had the Doctor a ſpirit of divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to know what had been ordered in the firſt days conference? If he had not, this anſwer of the Kings proved not the Doctor's objection to be frivolous, but rather handſomely implied it to have ſome weight in it.</p>
               <p>The Doctor being already acquitted of vanity, let us now ſee what the framers of the Article might mean by inſerting the words <hi>in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi> King <hi>Edwards</hi> Article was thus worded,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:105061:109"/>
                  <hi>It is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office of publick preaching, or miniſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Congregation, before he be lawfully call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſent to execute the ſame. And thoſe we ought to judge lawfully called and ſent, which be choſen and called by men who have publick autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity given them in the Congregation, to call and ſend Miniſters into the Lords Vineyard.</hi> And the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Article doth not differ, unleſs it be altered ſince Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> his time. Out of the laſt clauſe of the Article I argue thus: Thoſe ought to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lawfully called and ſent, which be choſen and called to the work of the Miniſtry by men who have publick authority given unto them in the Congregation, to call and ſend Miniſters into the Lords Vineyard. Some not ordained by Biſhops have, <hi>&amp;c. ergo.</hi> This ſyllogiſm might, if urged, make ſome work and ſtir, and therefore I do not ſo much as form it in words at length. Still I am unſatisfied why the words <hi>[in the Congregation]</hi> are added either in the firſt or ſecond clauſe of the Article; but at adventure I am glad they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, until it be in ſome publick Record of our Churches doctrine defined what preaching is; for if Reading be Preaching, then I ſhould not be over-forward to ſubſcribe that it is not lawful for Laicks to preach privately.</p>
               <p>About Confirmation the Doctor obſerved (as the Relator tells us, p. 25) a contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>25th</hi> Article, and the words uſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it in the Collect for Confirmation in the Communion-book; and therefore deſired that both the contradiction might be conſidered, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:105061:109"/>the ground of Confirmation examined.</p>
               <p>In this we are told, p. 31. was obſerved a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity or malice; for the Article inſinuates, <hi>That the making of Confirmation to be a Sacrament, is a corrupt imitation of the Apoſtles; but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion book aiming at the right uſe and proper ſource thereof, makes it to be according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles example; and his Majeſty comparing both pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, concluded the objection to be a meer cavil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing the Article is by all Miniſters to be ſubſcribed, I ſhall be glad if it can be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the meaning is only, that the making of Confirmation to be a Sacrament, is a corrupt following of the Apoſtles; but that it ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate ſomething more, can hardly be denied by any one that reads the whole <hi>ſyntax.</hi> But the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in the Collect for Confirmation, ſaith <hi>inter alia, VVe make our humble ſupplications unto thee for theſe thy ſervants, upon whom, after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of thy holy Apoſtles, we lay our hands.</hi> In which words I would fain know who are included in the <hi>[we];</hi> for I take it, that the Biſhop alone lays on hands; and let no Miniſter deſire to join with him in impoſition of hands for confirmation, if he muſt be ſuppoſed to ſay that he doth it after the example of the holy Apoſtles; for that ever the Apoſtles laid hands on any that had been duly baptized in their in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ancy, to confirm them, may be ſooner ſaid, than firmly proved; yet if it can be proved that they did, I ſhall heartily rejoyce; for the more apoſtolical Confirmation proves to be, the more eaſily and chearfully I hope it will be ſubmitted to. This I find, that in the old Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:105061:110"/>no one queſtion was to be propounded to the Confirmand; in the new there is one to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and it is ſuch a one as may make all ungodly wretches afraid to have it propounded to them: ſure I am, without horrible hypocriſie they cannot anſwer to it affirmatively. But then the new Liturgy hath chopped off two of the Conſiderations for which, in the old, Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſaid to be appointed; the reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as I cannot certainly tell, ſo I will not uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conjecture; though I have heard ſtories a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this affair, that ſtartled me.</p>
               <p>Biſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> ſaith, Confer. p. 32. <hi>That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation was not ſo much founded upon the places in the</hi> Acts of the Apoſtles, <hi>which ſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had often ſhewed; but upon</hi> Heb. 6.2. <hi>where it is made a part of the Apoſtles Catechiſm:</hi> In the firſt days Conference he had ſaid, <hi>It was ſet down and named in expreſs words,</hi> Heb. 6 2. and <hi>affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be an Inſtitution Apoſtolical,</hi> p. 11.</p>
               <p>Here I may, I hope, enquire what the Biſhop meant by ſaying, <hi>Confirmation was not ſo much founded on the places in the</hi> Acts, <hi>which ſome of the Fathers had often ſhewed.</hi> What doth <hi>which</hi> relate to? Have ſome of the Fathers often ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Confirmation is not ſo much founded upon the places in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles?</hi> If they have, down falls preſently much of many of our Epiſcopal brethrens building concerning Epiſcopacy, if they have ſhewn no ſuch thing; I cannot make ſenſe of the Biſhop's ſaying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the places in the <hi>Acts.</hi> As for <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. I am willing to think that by laying on of hands
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:105061:110"/>there, may be ſignified Confirmation: but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not much blame thoſe who differ from me in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding that place; for I find Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the laying on of hands, to the ordaining of Miniſters; others refer it to that and ſundry other things performed by impoſition of hands; theſe would count themſelves wronged, if one ſhould ſay, <hi>That they deny that which is ſet down and named in expreſs words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> (I muſt not forget that) is related p. 11. <hi>to have noted ſomething out of the Goſpel of St.</hi> Matthew, <hi>for the impoſition of hands upon children.</hi> He might out of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel have obſerved many things concerning Chriſts laying of hands on the children brought to him. But the difficulty will be, how to make thoſe things pertinent to the laying on of hands upon thoſe who are too big many times to be called little children, and are already baptized, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be orderly admitted to the Lords Supper; and when theſe are made appear pertinent, then it will be worth conſideration, whether the Biſhops ſhould not rather ſay, <hi>VVe lay on hands in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt,</hi> than <hi>in imitation of the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But all this while the main Controverſie about Confirmation is not touched, which relates to the Miniſter of Confirmation, which Dr.</hi> Reynolds <hi>and his party would have had in their own hands, whereas none of all the Fathers ever admitted any to confirm, but Biſhops alone, as ſaid the Biſhops of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Wincheſter, p. 34, 35.</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:105061:111"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To me this is not the main queſtion, let our Biſhops cenſure thoſe who admit to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuch as can neither ſay Lords-Prayer, Belief, Ten Commandments, nor anſwer the queſtions in the Common Prayer-Book Catechiſm, nor are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed or deſirous to be confirmed; let alſo the Biſhops themſelves ride through their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes, and confirm all that are unconfirmed, and ſuſpend ſuch from the Sacrament as either are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing or unmeet to be confirmed, and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf, the <hi>Presbyters</hi> will not be vexed that ſo much work is taken off their hands.</p>
               <p>As for what His Majeſty is made to ſay, pag. 36. <hi>That it ſuits neither with the Authority, nor decency of Confirmation, that every ordinary Paſtor ſhould do it and that there was as great reaſon that none ſhould confirm without licence from the Biſhop, as none Preach without his licence.</hi> I doubt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator hath both wronged the King and the Biſhops cauſe; The King, for we can ſcarce conceive he ſhould have ſuch high thoughts of the Authority or decency of confirmation, as to imagine, that either was leſſened by being adminiſtred by thoſe by whom Baptiſm is adminiſtred. And the Biſhops cauſe alſo, for it will not ſerve their turn that <hi>Presbyters</hi> ſhould not confirm without their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, as they do not Preach without their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, unleſs it be alſo made appear that none can be licenſed to confirm but themſelves. Before I paſs from this, I muſt alſo advert, <hi>That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator makes the King to tax St.</hi> Jerome <hi>for aſſerting, that a Biſhop is not</hi> Divinae ordinationis; and the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> to inſert, <hi>That if he could not
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:105061:111"/>prove his ordination lawful, out of the Scriptures, he would not be a Biſhop four hours.</hi> Wherein I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the policy of the Biſhop, who reſerved pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to himſelf to continue a Biſhop if he could prove his ordination lawful by the Scriptures; he knew well enough that his Ordination might be lawful, and vet a Biſhop not be <hi>Divinae Ordinationis.</hi> That is lawful by Scripture, which no Scripture Law condemns, or forbids; but he that ſhould ſay, that every thing not prohibited, is <hi>Divinae ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationis,</hi> would have much a-do to prove that he himſelf had any meetneſs to be conſecrated a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. I ſuppoſe I can prove that it is lawful for me to wear a Beaver; but when I had ſo proved, ſhould I not be ridiculous, if I ſhould ſay that a Beaver was <hi>Divinae ordinationis?</hi> Beſides, if Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> had chanced to gravel the Biſhop with an argument about the lawfulneſs of his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he to keep his Biſhoprick, would preſently have replied that he was ordained to be a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but he was only conſecrated to be a Biſhop, and by that means he might have kept his lands and his credit too.</p>
               <p>Let us now proceed with Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> who is made to ſay, <hi>that the words in the 37th Article, The Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>hath no authority in this land,</hi> be not ſufficient unleſs it were added, <hi>nor ought to have.</hi> It is like the Doctor had obſerved that the Oath of Supremacy runs to that or the like effect.</p>
               <p>And he had never heard, it is as like, that the King and his Council heartily laughed at the framers of that Oath, and therefore ſcarce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:105061:112"/>to be told, that a <hi>Puritan</hi> was a Proteſtant frighted out of his wits, for propounding that the Article might be as fully worded as the Oath; yet it ſeems he had the hap to be laughed at for his honeſt well-meant motion; ſo the Relator ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us, <hi>p.</hi> 37.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 38. The Dr. moved that this propoſition, <hi>The intention of the Miniſter is not of the eſſence of the Sacrament,</hi> might be added unto the Book of Articles, <hi>the rather, becauſe ſome in</hi> England <hi>had preached it to be eſſential.</hi> Had it been told him that if he would name thoſe men who ſo Preached, they ſhould be ſuſpended, till they had recalled ſo falſe and uncomfortable an opinion, or that there was enough in the Articles to infer that the intention of the Miniſter is not eſſential to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, it had been ſufficient; but to ſay that His Majeſty utterly diſliked this motion for two reaſons, and to name but one of the two, and to ſtuff up that with a ſtory concerning Mr. <hi>Craig,</hi> was to put the world under a temptation to think too meanly of their King. <hi>It is unfit to thruſt every poſition negative into the Book of Articles, for that would ſwell the Book into a volume as big as the Bible, and alſo confound the Reader; therefore I may not inſert this ſhort poſition, the Miniſters intention is not of the eſſence of the Sacrament, into the Engliſh Articles.</hi> This is made to be the Kings argument; to which, whether Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> could reply nothing, others may judge.</p>
               <p>Here we might alſo ſpeak of the Nine Articles of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> put into the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Confeſſion, not long after this Conference, but never put into
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:105061:112"/>ours, though it ſeems the Doctor moved twice they might be put in. For my part I am not ſorry they are left out; for ſome honeſt men may queſtion the truth of them, and not be able in faith to ſubſcribe them, and ſo the Church loſe the benefit of their parts: As for <hi>Latitudinarians,</hi> they would have ſubſcribed them in a ſenſe of their own deviſing, though they had thought them falſe in the ſenſe of the framers and impoſers of them; or they would have ſaid, that by ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they did not declare the aſſent of their minds to the truth of the Articles, but only their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not to publiſh their diſſent to them, ſo as to make a diſturbance in the Church about them. A Jeſuit Papiſt, and a <hi>Latitudinarian</hi> Proteſtant will ſtick at no ſubſcription whatſoever.</p>
               <p>As for the Dean of <hi>Paul,</hi> his diſcourſe to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himſelf, I am not concerned to contradict him in it; but I think he contradicts himſelf, if Dr. <hi>Barlow</hi> doth him no wrong, <hi>p.</hi> 41, 42.</p>
               <p>The motion made by the Dr. and related <hi>p.</hi> 43. concerning a Catechiſm, produced a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able addition to the old Catechiſm, which was all he aimed at in it; alſo he ſucceeded in his motion, that a ſtraiter courſe might be taken for reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the general abuſe and prophanation of the Sabbath day; for that, the Relator ſaith, found a general and unanimous aſſent. So that the Biſhops then did not think it <hi>Judaiſm</hi> to call the Lords day Sabbath, nor to provide for its ſanctification.</p>
               <p>Nor did he miſcarry in his motion for a new Tranſlation of the Bible; for not long after the Conference, a new one was publiſhed, which hath
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:105061:113"/>been generally uſed ever ſince, to Gods glory, and the Churches edification.</p>
               <p>As for his Majeſties profeſſion <hi>that he could never yet ſee a Bible well tranſlated into Engliſh, and that the</hi> Geneva <hi>Tranſlation was the worſt of all;</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Majeſty repented of it, or elſe he had not given leave to Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> to defend the two places in the <hi>Geneva</hi> Notes, that he took particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> for concluſion of what concerned doctrine, moved, <hi>That unlawful and ſeditious books might be ſuppreſſed, at leaſt reſtrained and imparted to a few.</hi> This a man might think would have been entertained with a general aſſent and conſent, but contrariwiſe, the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> ſuppoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be principally aimed at, anſwereth to what he was never accuſed of, and ſaith, but without any proof, <hi>That the Book,</hi> De Jure Magiſtratus in ſubditos, <hi>was publiſhed by a great diſciplinarian,</hi> but named him not; and the King is ſaid to tell the Doctor, that he was a better Colledg-man than Stateſman; and by this means no courſe was taken to prevent ſuch Commentaries both in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy and Divinity as came into <hi>England</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas to the corrupting and poiſoning of young ſtudents in the Univerſity.</p>
               <p>The motion about Paſtors reſident and learned, <hi>pag.</hi> 51, 52, 53, is handſomly avoided by the King, with an anſwer, that he had conſulted with his Biſhops about that, <hi>whom he found ready and willing to ſecond him in it, &amp;c.</hi> yet all that Kings days, and ever ſince, the Nation hath groaned under the burden of an unlearned and non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:105061:113"/>Miniſtry; if the Law of the Land admit of very mean and tolerable ſufficiency in any Clerks, why have not the Biſhops petitioned that the Law be altered ſo as to require greater ſufficiency? And if the Lay-Patrons are to blame, who preſent very mean men to their Cures; are Eccleſiaſtical-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons to be excuſed, who preſent Clerks every way as mean?</p>
               <p>Now come the Biſhop of <hi>Londons</hi> motions to be conſidered, in number Three:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there might be amongſt us a praying Miniſtry; he meant a Miniſtry that might read the Common-Prayer-Book, to which very little learning indeed would ſuffice; but I ſuppoſe there was then no want of ſuch a Miniſtry, nor is there now; ſo that the motion might have been ſpared.</p>
               <p>The Second motion was, that till a ſufficient and learned Miniſter might be placed in every Congregation, godly Homilies might be read, and the number of them encreaſed. This motion ſure was not liked, for unto this day neither is a learned Miniſter ſetled in every Congregation, nor the number of Homilies encreaſed.</p>
               <p>His laſt motion was, that Pulpits might not be made Paſquils, wherein every humorous fellow or diſcontented, might traduce his ſuperiors.</p>
               <p>This the King graciouſly accepted, and ſo did the complaining Miniſters, as I ſuppoſe; for that the Pulpit ſhould be made a Stage is certainly a very lewd cuſtom, but obtains too too much among I know whom.</p>
               <p>Proceed we with Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> to Subſcription,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:105061:114"/>as to which, we find him only deſiring, that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters might be put upon it, to ſubſcribe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Statutes of the Realm, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion, and the Kings ſupremacy; to ſubſcribe otherwiſe they could not, becauſe among other things, the Common Prayer-Book enjoined the Reading of ſome Chapters, in which were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt errors directly repugnant to Scriptures, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancing particularly in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> 48.10. where the words inferr, <hi>That Elias in perſon was to come before Chriſt; and if ſo, Chriſt is not yet come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let us take notice of what is anſwered:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Biſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> anſwers, <q>That the moſt of the objections againſt the Books of <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> were the old cavils of the <hi>Jews,</hi> renewed by St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in his time, who was the firſt that gave them the name of <hi>Apocrypha;</hi> which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, upon <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his challenge, he, after a ſort, diſclaimed; the rather, becauſe a general offence was taken at his ſpeeches in that kind.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This, I muſt needs ſay, was a politick anſwer: for firſt we are told, that not all the objections, but ſome of the objections againſt theſe books, are the old cavils of the <hi>Jews</hi> renewed by St. <hi>Jerome.</hi> 2. We are told, that St. <hi>Jerome</hi> was the firſt that called theſe Books Apocryphal; which opinion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort he reclaimed upon <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge.</p>
               <p>What can any man reply to ſuch an anſwer? ſhould one bring an objection againſt theſe books, that the <hi>Jews</hi> never would have brought, he would have been told, That not all objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, but only ſome, are <hi>Jewiſh</hi> cavils:
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:105061:114"/>Should one ſay that <hi>Jerome</hi> diſclaimed not his opinion concerning books Apocryphal, he would be told, That he did not indeed diſclaim his opinion abſolutely; but yet <hi>after a ſort</hi> he did; and how far <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>after a ſort,</hi> may reach, no one can tell: Nor have we the leaſt reference to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place of <hi>Jerome</hi>'s Works in which this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming of his opinion is recorded (whether St. <hi>Jerome</hi> diſclaimed his opinion, he who hath not St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s Works by him, may find diſcuſſed in Dr. <hi>Coſens</hi> his Scholaſtical Hiſtory of the Canon of Scripture): I ſay, it cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned why the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould leſs eſteem the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal books than they deſerved; they retain the Canonical books of the Old Teſtament, which make more againſt them than the Apocrypha. Nor is St. <hi>Jerome</hi> the firſt who called the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal books by the name of <hi>Apocrypha;</hi> others before him had given them that name, or one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent, as I can make appear. Indeed the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of the Church have ſo blaſted ſome eſpecially of the Apocryphal Writings, that I cannot but wonder how they came to be read in our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The Hiſtory of <hi>Suſanna</hi> was accounted a Fable even by <hi>Julius Africanus,</hi> contemporary to <hi>Origen;</hi> and yet our neweſt Calendar appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to be read, as alſo the ſtory of <hi>Bell</hi> and <hi>Dragon.</hi> There is a common ſaying in mens mouths, that theſe books are Canonical, not for the confirming of our faith, but the regulating of our manners; but he who ſhall make all Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal books a rule for his manners, may chance to ſet more on his Doomſday-book than he will
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:105061:115"/>quickly get off again. As for him who ſhall make them a rule of Faith, he will undoubtedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Heretick.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> his inſtance the Biſhops would not meddle with; but the King, who was not in conference to be contradicted, p. 62. is made 1. To argue and demonſtrate, That whatſoever <hi>Ben Sirach</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 48.10. of <hi>Elias, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> had in his own perſon while he lived, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and accompliſhed. 2. To check Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> for impoſing on a man that was dead, a ſenſe never meant by him. 3. To uſe a pleaſant apoſtrophe to the Lords, <hi>VVhat trow ye makes theſe men ſo angry with</hi> Eccleſiaſticus? <hi>By my ſoul I think he was a Biſhop, or elſe they would never uſe him ſo.</hi> 4.

               <p>Had the Relator conſulted the Kings honour, he had not inſerted one of his Jeers managed with an Oath, into a Conference concerning Religion; nor would he, had he regarded his own reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have called a ſarcaſm, in which was an oath, an unneceſſary oath, <hi>a pleaſant apoſtrophe.</hi> To the place it ſelf, I ſay the <hi>Greek</hi> copies, (<hi>Ecclus.</hi> 48.10.) much differ among themſelves, and as much from the <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation; our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alſo greatly vary; but I could never yet meet with any Copy or Tranſlation from which at leaſt an unwary Reader or hearer would not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Tranſlatour carry it clearly for <hi>Elias</hi> his being to come before the day of the Lord, to turn the hearts of the children to the Parents, as may be ſeen in the <hi>Polyglotts.</hi> So that if the Doctor was miſtaken about the meaning of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> his miſtake was common to him with many more of great eſteem, and deſerved not to be put off either with a check or a flout. Whether D. <hi>R.</hi> ever brought in a liſt of the offenſive chapters in the Apocryphal books, I cannot tell; but I can find, that ſince King <hi>James</hi> his time, the people have had in Parochial Churches leſs Apocrypha, and more Canonical Scripture; perhaps at laſt the divinely inſpired Writings that have in and on them ſo many expreſs ſignatures of Holineſs and Majeſty, ſhall prevail to have the ſole honour of being read in the Churches for Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>As to the next ſcruple about ſubſcription, grounded on, <hi>Jeſus ſaid to his diſciples,</hi> when he ſpake to the Phariſees; it ſeems the King took order to have the Tranſlation reformed.</p>
               <p>Now muſt Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> for a ſeaſon give way to Mr. <hi>Knewſtubbe</hi> a <hi>Cantabrigian,</hi> and a very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Divine, though not much known by any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings he left behind him. He is ſaid by Dr. <hi>Barlow</hi> to have objected againſt the Interrogatories in Baptiſm propounded to Infants; but what it was he ſaid againſt propounding thoſe Interrogatories to the Infants, we are not told; but rather made
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:105061:116"/>believe his diſcourſe was ſo perplext, that the King profeſſed he underſtood it not. The Biſhop of <hi>VVinton</hi> aiming at his meaning, ſhewed the uſe of ſuch Interrogatories out of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> adding his reaſon, <hi>Qui peccavit in altero, credat in altero.</hi> Glad am I to find that one <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhop, without contradiction from any other joined with him, did allow St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s ſaying that an Infant may <hi>peccare in altero;</hi> I hope if any now laugh at the notion of our ſinning in <hi>Adam,</hi> they will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg themſelves to have embraced an opinion quite different from the opinion of thoſe to whom they ſucceed. In the mean time I ſhall be glad to hear it proved, that a child can <hi>credere in altero;</hi> for I rather opine, that a Parents Faith is ſo far accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, as to entitle his child to Baptiſm, than that the child of a believer doth believe in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving father: for if he believe in him, he muſt be ſaved in him, if he dye in his Infant-ſtate; and I would give all I am worth to hear it proved, that all the Infants of godly Parents dying in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, are ſaved. But of this no more. Our new Liturgy hath almoſt taken away the ground of the diſpute concerning theſe Interrogatories; for it ordereth that the firſt Interrogatory ſhould be thus propounded: <hi>Doſt thou in the name of this child,</hi> &amp;c. which words I have not obſerved in the old Liturgy. But yet I would fain know why we may not as well ask the Father, <hi>Wilt thou that this child be baptized in this faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Paſs we from the Interrogatories, to the croſs in Baptiſm, which Mr. <hi>Knewſtubbe</hi> took excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to, in number two: Firſt, the offence of weak
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:105061:116"/>brethren, grounded on the words of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 14. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>viz.</hi> the conſciences of the weak are not to be offended. Theſe places being the chief ſeat of the doctrine of ſcandal, deſerve a moſt ſerious conſideration; for certainly we ſhould take heed not to deſtroy thoſe for whom Chriſt died.</p>
               <p>And this care is principally to be taken by the Church in making Canons; if ſhe only command things which Chriſt hath commanded, who is he that can blame her, or think ſhe exceeds the bounds and limits of the power given her? but if ſhe command that which ſhe confeſſeth ſhe need not command, and which ſhe cannot but know many account unlawful; and if ſhe command ſuch a thing under the higheſt penalty; then hath ſhe reaſon to conſider whether ſuch precepts will be pleaſing to her Lord? It will ſignifie little to ask how long people will be weak? for no doubt they will be weak while the world ſtands. As little will it ſignifie to ſay, Subſcriptions are not required of Laicks and Ideots, but Preachers and Miniſters; for it is notorious that Subſcriptions are required of Freſh-men at their matriculation in the Univerſity, when to be ſure they are Laicks, and not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Controverſies in Religion. As for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they ſhould not be weak in faith, but they muſt conſider that they have under them ſuch as are weak; and not ſuddenly engage never to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter neceſſary Ordinances unto them, unleſs they will receive them with diſputable Ceremonies. If a ſingle Miniſter were left to his own choice either to croſs the child he baptizeth, or not to croſs it, ought he not to ſay, If by croſſing I ſhall ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:105061:117"/>my brother, I will not croſs a child while the world ſtands. It will be ſaid, that a ſingle Miniſter is not left at his liberty. True; but the Church was at liberty to make or not to make a Law about croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Had ſhe made no Law to croſs children that are baptized, then I ſuppoſe no Miniſter would have croſſed any child; and what damage the child would have ſuſtained by not being croſſed, it is paſt my skill to imagine; by making a Law that all children that ſhall be baptized publickly, ſhall be alſo croſſed, many learned Miniſters are put out of Livings, many are made to lay aſide the thoughts of being Miniſters, and divert to Law or Phyſick, a bone of contention is caſt among the common people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What ought the Church to do in this caſe?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Knewſtubbe's</hi> ſecond Argument is ſaid to have conſiſted of three interrogatories:</p>
               <p>I would ask one queſtion that was not then by him asked, <hi>viz. Whether it will be as profitable for the Child to be ſigned with any other ſign, as with the ſign of that Croſs upon which our Saviour did ſuffer death?</hi> If it will not (as no doubt, moſt will ſay it will not) then we muſt be firſt inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what figure our Saviours Croſs was of, leſt in going about to make the ſign of it, we ſhould make the ſign of ſomewhat elſe. And how ſhall we know what figure our Saviours Croſs was of? The <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> will afford us little light in this matter; for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, though affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a great Critick, firſt to ſignifie the ſame with <hi>Furca,</hi> then with <hi>Crux,</hi> yet is known by thoſe who have obſerved its uſe in <hi>Hemer</hi> and other Authors,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:105061:117"/>to have no other original ſignification than of a Stake. If we betake our ſelves to the Fathers, they ſpeak ſtrangely and variouſly concerning the figure of the Croſs: <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> ſay, that the <hi>Samaritan</hi> letter <hi>Tau</hi> repreſents the figure of a Croſs, than which ſaith <hi>Scaliger nothing is more falſe; nothing more true,</hi> ſaith Dr. <hi>Walton</hi> in his <hi>Prolegomena;</hi> yet the character of the <hi>Samaritan Tau,</hi> now in uſe, hath no reſemblance with a Croſs, what character it may have in old medals and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, ſober men will not much regard. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> dealing with <hi>Trypho</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> will find figures and types of the Croſs in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> where the Spirit never intended any. Yea, in his ſecond Apology for Chriſtians, he bids the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens conſider, whether without this figure, men could adminiſter any thing, or have any converſe with one another. The Unicorns horn, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it, doth indeed fairly repreſent ſuch a kind of Croſs, as it is moſt probable our Saviour ſuffered on, for that ſeemeth to have been made of a piece of wood fixed in the earth, with a tranſverſe beam faſtned unto it towards the top, and another piece of wood infixed into, and ſtanding out from that which was erected and ſtraight up; but that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> thought of any ſuch thing when he bleſſed <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, Deut.</hi> 33.17. or that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> aimed at any ſuch thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.21. is ſo improbable, that it is well we have other types and prophecies of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> to produce againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom a crucified Chriſt is a ſtumbling block. But now, which of our Deacons or Prieſts doth, in croſſing a Child, repreſent the five extremities
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:105061:118"/>of the <hi>Roman</hi> Croſs? The aforeſaid <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in his Apology ſuggeſts, that <hi>Philo</hi> having read the ſtory in <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning the Brazen Serpent, and not underſtanding that it was the ſign of a Croſs which he made, but rather a decuſſation, ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Yet I believe it were no hard matter to find ſome Chriſtian Writers that make the <hi>Roman</hi> X to be the Croſs, and that is <hi>crux decuſſata,</hi> or an <hi>Andrews</hi> Croſs, as I think we were taught to call it when we learnt Arithmetick. To be brief, I think that if Chriſt had intended his Picture ſhould have been ſet up in Churches, he would have left us ſome ſure way to know his viſage. 2. If he had deſigned the Croſs on which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, any honour, he would have taken care that it ſhould be preſerved. 3. If he had ordained to teach his Church by the ſign of the Croſs, he would have left us at no uncertainty how to make it. As for the viſage of our Saviour, that that is unknown, I would fain think that no man now doubts. For though it be reported by <hi>Damaſcen</hi> and <hi>Evagrius,</hi> that our Saviour ſent his Picture un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abgarus</hi> Prince of <hi>Edeſſa;</hi> yet it is by them reported on the credit of they tell us they know not whom, and neither of them deſcribe what a kind of man he was: Beſides <hi>Euſebius</hi> who wrote the ſtory of matters ſuppoſed to paſs betwixt Chriſt and <hi>Abgarus</hi> out of the Records of <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> hath not one word of this Picture. Of another image of our Saviour made by <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> mention is made in a piece attributed to <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> but falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the more ingenuous <hi>Papiſts</hi> acknowledg. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:105061:118"/>Caliſtus</hi> alſo, <hi>Lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap. ult.</hi> hath given us a very particular account of Chriſts face and body, as to figure and form. <hi>James Nailor,</hi> as I have been told, when brought to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his blaſphemy in making himſelf Chriſt, had, as near as he could, made himſelf to look like ſuch a man as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> hath deſcribed; but as I ſuppoſe that no man in his wits took that blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer to be Chriſt, ſo no man that hath much wiſdom will believe, that <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> at above a Thouſand years diſtance, is to be much credited concerning our Saviours feature and complexion, eſpecially, till he have named the authors whom he follows. The Croſs of Chriſt, we are told, was found by <hi>Helena</hi> the Mother of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, Three hundred years after his ſufferings: but the Story appeareth to have little probability in it. We muſt ſuppoſe that there were in that place juſt Three Croſſes and no more, and that by a miracle thoſe Three Croſſes were preſerved from putrefaction; now if any man can think that our Saviours Croſs was ſo miraculouſly preſerved, yet to what end ſhould the two Thieves Croſſes be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, unleſs it were to trouble and perplex thoſe, who ſhould be ſo ſimple as to look after that which was nowhere to be found? But how did the ſeekers after this Croſs, diſtinguiſh it from the Croſſes of the two Thieves? were the Croſſes only found, and not the Titles ſignifying what the crime was for which they were crucified? St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith the title was found; yet Queen <hi>Helen</hi> not truſting to that, by the counſel of the Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> expects a miracle, applies the Croſſes of the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:105061:119"/>two Thieves to a dead man taken out of the <hi>Bier,</hi> but they put no life into him, which the Croſs of Chriſt, as ſoon as it touched him, preſently did; others ſay, that the Croſs at that time did not reſtore a dead man to life, but only recovered a <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> woman that lay ſick of a very deſperate diſeaſe: and <hi>Sozomen,</hi> as I take it, reports it to have wrought both theſe miracles at one time. O! how little ſound knowledg was then in the world, when Chriſtians of prime note took ſuch pains to find out that which no way cooperated to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, but was only a paſſive inſtrument of our Saviours ſufferings materially conſidered? Is that Croſs of wood, if it could now be found, a meet object of religious, or ſo much as civil honour? What uſe could it be of, unleſs there ſhould appear ſomething in the make of it, that would ſerve to illuſtrate ſome form of ſpeech in ſacred or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Authors? As for ſtirring up of ſorrow, the Word and Sacraments are much more apt to do that than any ſight of the Croſs on which our Saviour did hang. But great miracles have been wrought by the Croſs, and fragments or pieces of it, yea, by the ſign of it. I muſt not deny but that many things very wonderful are reported to be done by the Croſs. But perhaps ſometimes theſe wonders were wrought by the Devil, to deceive inordinate worſhippers of ſuch images, God permitting, and the infidelity of men neceſſarily requiring it, that I may make uſe of <hi>Biels</hi> words. 2. If God at any time did do a miracle, the Croſs it ſelf being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, or the ſign of it made, it muſt be the Faith and Prayer of the perſon uſing the Croſs, that God
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:105061:119"/>reſpected in putting forth his power, and not the Croſs. 3. I do much doubt that the one half of thoſe things which are reported to be done by the Croſs, were never done at all. The higheſt ſtory that ever I read concerning the effects of the Croſs, and which is made uſe of by almoſt every Popiſh Writer in this matter, is the delivering of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate from the ſpirits with which he was frighted, upon the making the ſign of the Croſs, though he had before renounced it. Such a thing I find indeed in <hi>Nazianzen</hi>'s firſt invective againſt <hi>Julian.</hi> But the Father reports it only on hearſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but I would fain know how the report was firſt raiſed, none pretended (that we find) to have had it either from <hi>Julian</hi> himſelf, or from the Conjurer that was with him; yet if men had it not from them, they muſt needs feign it themſelves. The ſame Father had before told us, that when <hi>Julian</hi> was ſacrificing, the intrails of the Beaſt ſhewed him a crowned Croſs; but he prefaceth that Story thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which it may appear, that this Father did not ſtick to put into his writings, ſuch ſtories as he would not averr to be true, when he conceived they might ſerve his turn. Had all that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported as ſtrange matters concerning the Croſs, been ſo ingenuous, as to let us know that they went but upon common fame, Staurolatry had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to ſuch an height as it hath now attained in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. But let us now conſider Mr. <hi>Knewſtubbes</hi> queſtions:</p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:105061:120"/>
               <p n="1">1. Whether the Church had power to inſtitute an external ſignificant ſign?</p>
               <p>For anſwer, it might have been expected that the Churches charter to inſtitute ſuch ſignificant ſigns ſhould have been produced and read to the Queſtioniſt; but inſtead of doing ſo, it was repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he did miſtake the uſe of the croſs with us, which was not uſed in Baptiſm any otherwiſe than only as a ceremony. Which was a pretty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply indeed, and implieth that a ceremony cannot be an external ſignificant ſign, or elſe was a moſt inſignificant anſwer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they themſelves made impoſition of hands in their ordination of Paſtors, to be a ſign ſignificant. Which Reply ſuppoſeth, 1. That they ordained Paſtors (the which I never heard they did.) 2. That there is the ſame reaſon of a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony uſed, and perhaps commanded by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that there is of ceremonies never uſed nor commanded by them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <q>The kneeling on the ground, the lifting up our hands, the knocking of our breaſts, are cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies ſignificant, and yet are and may lawfully be uſed, ſaid the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi>
                  </q> But he might as well have held his peace; for though theſe be ſignificant ceremonies, yet they are not of that claſs of ſignificant ceremonies which <hi>Nonconform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts</hi> ſcruple; for the ſcrupled ceremonies are ſuch as have humane inſtitution, ordained ſignification, myſtical ſignification, appropriation to Gods ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Worſhip and Service. And the ceremonies the Biſhop inſtanced in, though lawful, are none of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:105061:120"/>them commanded by the Church, nor will be (I ſuppoſe) in haſte.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <q>Dr. <hi>Montague</hi> Dean of the Chappel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the practice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who unto the Inſtitution of the Paſſover preſcribed unto them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> had, as the <hi>Rabbins</hi> witneſs, added both ſigns and words, eating ſowr herbs, and drinking wine, with theſe words to both, <hi>Take, eat theſe in remembrance, drink this in remembrance;</hi> upon which addition and tradition of theirs, our Saviour inſtituted the Sacrament of the laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in celebrating it with the ſame words, and after the ſame manner; thereby approving that fact of theirs in particular, and generally that a Church may inſtitute and retain a ſignificant ſign. Which ſatisfied his Majeſty exceeding well.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here is a foundation laid, and then a ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture raiſed on it. The foundation is, that the <hi>Jews</hi> unto the inſtitution of the Paſſover preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> had added both ſigns and words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but is not this foundation laid in the ſand, depending on the teſtimony of later <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,</hi> whoſe teſtimonies are by wiſe men eſteemed lighter than vanity? The apoſtate <hi>Jews</hi> were no doubt grown wretchedly ſuperſtitious; but I am loth to believe, unleſs I needs muſt, that they uſed all the fopperies their <hi>Rabbins</hi> mention as in uſe with them. But be this as it will, I wonder what made the Reverend Dean ſay, that the eating of ſowr herbs was an addition to the Paſchal Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſowr herbs were as much commanded as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread. The <hi>Jews</hi> had indeed of their own heads added to the Paſchal proviſions a diſh of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:105061:121"/>thick ſawce made of Dates, Figs, Raiſins and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar mingled together (as ſome Authors ſay) to put them in mind of the clay in which their fathers laboured.</p>
               <p>Allowing them to have uſed this ſauce and wine, and whatever elſe ſuperſtition could dictate to them, how appears it, that upon any addition or tradition of theirs Chriſt inſtituted his Sacrament? or that he had not inſtituted the ſupper before the <hi>Jews</hi> made theſe additions? If we look upon Chriſt in the days of his abode here on earth, we find him to have ſhewed no great reſpect to the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ceremonies of the <hi>Jews</hi> that had no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution, as may be made appear by many inſtances, if it were worth while; ſo far was he from allowing his Churches to add any thing to his own inſtitutions that nature did not call for.</p>
               <p>We are told by the Relator, <hi>p.</hi> 68. That here the King deſired to be acquainted how ancient the uſe of the Croſs was. Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> confeſſed it to have been ever ſince the Apoſtles times (mark, he did not confeſs it to have been uſed in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times, nor did the Biſhops or any of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents ſay it was uſed by them) but the difficulty was, whether it were of that ancient uſe in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm? To remove this difficulty, the Dean of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> produceth <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Origen,</hi> ſaying it was in uſe in <hi>immortali lavacro.</hi> The Bp. of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> added, it was in uſe in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, <hi>pag.</hi> 69. whereupon the King concluded, <hi>If then it were uſed, I ſee no reaſon, but it may ſtill be retained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the antiquity of ſigning with the ſign of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:105061:121"/>the Croſs in Baptiſm, the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, That it was as ancient to uſe the ſign of the Croſs when people went abroad, or entred into the Church, or prayed, as when a child was baptized. If we may leave off the frequent uſe of croſſing upon other occaſions, without any diſhonour to the Fathers, why may we not alſo leave off croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in Baptiſm? Anointing alſo was uſed in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm by the Fathers; yet it is accounted a piece of our Reformation not to uſe anointing; what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparagement to the Reformation would it be to leave off croſſing alſo? Beſides, there was an uſe among the Fathers of the ſign of the croſs, which holds not for our times; and ſundry effects they expected from it, which we cannot, dare not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from it, becauſe we cannot find in Gods word a promiſe that any ſuch effect ſhall follow upon the croſſing our ſelves. All along Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign it was cuſtomary for the Queen to apply the ſign of the croſs to the tumour of the <hi>Strumoſi;</hi> King <hi>James</hi> diſcontinued that ceremony; and yet we do not find that he had leſs ſucceſs in the curing of the <hi>ſtrumous</hi> diſeaſe, than the Queen. So that the ſtrange and wonderful things pretended to be wrought by the ſign of the Croſs in the days of our ancient Doctors, were either not wrought at all, or if they were wrought, the ſign of the Croſs nothing contributed to the working of them. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, I marvel why the Dean of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to prove the antiquity of the Croſs in Baptiſm, did riſe no higher than <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Origen;</hi> they are not the ancienteſt Fathers that ſpeak of Baptiſm; the two firſt erred in the very point of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:105061:122"/>Baptiſm; the laſt (if his Tranſlators have not abuſed him) was ſcarce ſound in any thing.</p>
               <p>But the Croſs was uſed in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s times, and why may it not now be uſed? ſhall we accuſe <hi>Conſtantine</hi> of Popery and Superſtition? Thus is the King ſaid to have argued in the Conference; and by his argument he gave us to underſtand, that he liked not that any one ſhould charge <hi>Conſtantine</hi> with <hi>Popery</hi> or Superſtition; I therefore will lay neither to his charge; but yet his purpoſe not to be baptized till he might be baptized in the ſame River where Chriſt was baptized, <hi>viz. Jordan,</hi> if it did not proceed from ſuperſtition, proceeded from a very odd humour. God croſſed him in that his deſign, and put him under a neceſſity either to receive Baptiſm in another place than <hi>Jordan,</hi> or not to receive it at all. (In this I follow <hi>Enſebius,</hi> for whom ſhould I rather follow than him who ſo well knew <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and hath tranſmitted his Hiſtory to poſterity? If any man incline to thoſe who would have <hi>Conſtantine</hi> baptized many years before at <hi>Rome,</hi> I leave him to <hi>Scultetus</hi> in his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla,</hi> who defends <hi>Euſebius</hi> againſt <hi>Baronius.</hi>)</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Knewſtubb</hi>'s ſecond queſtion was, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Church had power to add ſignificant ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, whether ſhe might there add them where Chriſt had already ordained one? Which he ſuppoſed was no leſs derogatory to Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, than if any Potentate of the Land ſhould preſume to add his Seal to the Great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:105061:122"/>
               <p>To this Dr. <hi>Barlow</hi> ſaith, p. 70. the King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>That the caſe was not alike; for that no ſign or thing was added to the Sacrament which was fully and perfectly finiſhed, before any menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Croſs is made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I dare not think this was King <hi>James</hi> his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: for it is only fitted and ſuted to our own Church as then it was ordered, and ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. In the firſt Book of King <hi>Edward,</hi> croſſing was appointed before Baptiſm could be pretended to be perfected, or indeed begun; which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the uſage of the ancient Churches. 2. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the preſumption of any ſubject would be great, if he ſhould add his own ſeal to confirm or ſignifie any thing that the King's Great Seal was appointed to confirm and ſignifie, though the Great Seal had been ſet before he ſet his Seal. 3. Methinks the argument ſtands ſtill in its full force; If applying of water to a believer in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt do ſignifie all that the Croſs ſignifies, to what end is the Croſs uſed? The child that is baptized with us, is obliged by Baptiſm obediently to keep Gods holy will and commandments, and walk in the ſame all the days of his life; what can the Croſs oblige him to more? Is not confeſſing the ſaith of Chriſt crucified, one of Gods commandments? I know a learned man hath replied, that conſtancy is not diſtinctly ſignified in being baptized, as it is in being croſſed. But I ask, Is it any benefit to a man to have ſome ceremony uſed that doth more diſtinctly mind him of his conſtancy than Baptiſm did? If it be none, then ſuch a ceremony is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:105061:123"/>if it be ſome benefit, how came it to paſs that no Apoſtle ever uſed any ſuch ceremony? and why do we not excogitate other ceremonies to admoniſh us as diſtinctly of other duties?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Knewſtubbes</hi> third queſtion was, In caſe the Church had power to inſtitute ſuch a ſign, how far ſuch an Ordinance was to bind them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impeaching their Chriſtian liberty?</p>
               <p>The King charged him never more to ſpeak to that point. And therefore I will not ſpeak to it at all, but muſt needs ſay it was an odd queſtion if it were ſo propounded as the Relator hath word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> is again brought on the ſtage, p. 71. objecting the example of the Brazen Serpent ſtampt to powder, becauſe the people abuſed it to Idolatry; wiſhing the Croſs, becauſe ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly abuſed, might be abandoned alſo.</p>
               <p>To this the King is made to ſay, 1. If it were abuſed to Superſtition in the time of Popery, that plainly implies, that it was well uſed before Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. As if nothing had been abuſed by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in Divine Worſhip, but what had been once well uſed. 2. That there is no reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Brazen Serpent, a material viſible thing, and the ſign of the Croſs made in the air. As if a thing made in the air, might not be abuſed to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition as well as a material viſible thing. 3. That the Papiſts themſelves did never aſcribe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:105061:123"/>any power or ſpiritual grace to the ſign of the Croſs in Baptiſm. Whether they did or no, their Writings will beſt teſtifie. 4. The material Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which in time of Popery were made for men to fall down before them, to worſhip, are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as they deſired. Whereas moſt preſent at the Conference knew that in many places they were not removed.</p>
               <p>The next thing objected, was the wearing of a Surplice, a kind of Garment which the Prieſts of <hi>Iſis</hi> uſed to wear.</p>
               <p>To which His Majeſty anſwered <hi>inter alia,</hi> That if Heathens were commorant among us, ſo as they might take occaſion to be ſtrengthned or confirmed in <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> then there were juſt cauſe to ſuppreſs the wearing of it. A notable anſwer, and which the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> may do well to treaſure up, as like to ſtand them in good ſtead in theſe controverſies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With my body I thee worſhip,</hi> is an old and odd phraſe; and if it may not be altered, it muſt be explained, and then <hi>Mumpſimus</hi> may do as well as <hi>Sumpſimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ring in Marriage Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> approved, and the corner'd cap. Committing of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical cenſures unto Lay-chancellors, the King promiſed to take order to reform, p. 78. And Archbiſhop <hi>Grindal</hi>'s propheſyings it is like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough His Majeſty would not have diſliked, if he had not miſunderſtood the deſign of them.</p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:105061:124"/>
               <p>And now I would fain know whether what the Biſhops got by this Conference, may not be put in a mans eye, and he never ſee the worſe. Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> got a great deal by it, <hi>viz.</hi> a new Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the Bible, ſuch an explication of the uſe of the Croſs, as (if the ſtory be true) he did acquieſce in; a large addition concerning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in the Church-catechiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> quarrels with King <hi>James</hi> for giving any way to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
               <p>There is but one thing more I will concern my ſelf to take notice of in Mr. <hi>Scrivener</hi>'s A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt the New Schiſm; he deſires to have one place in which <hi>Presbyter</hi> ſignifies a Lay-man. Though I think I could ſatisfie his deſire in this, yet I find not my ſelf on any account obliged ſo to do; for the <hi>Engliſh Nonconformiſts</hi> are not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-fond of Ruling-Elders; thoſe Churches that retain ſuch Officers, will not acknowledg them to be lay-men; nor indeed have they any reaſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg them to be ſuch. For why ſhould Church-officers choſen by the Church, and commended to the grace of God by prayer, be called laicks? becauſe they labour at ſome employment to keep themſelves from being chargeable to the congregation? why then the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was for ſome part of his time a Laick, for he laboured. And in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times I could inſtance in men that for their Learning and Piety deſerved to be Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, who yet were fain to preach and work.</p>
               <p>It were to be wiſhed, that many in <hi>England</hi> to whom the care of ſouls is committed, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:105061:124"/>and enjoyned to follow ſome calling in the week-days, for by that means they would be leſs ſcandalous than now they are. Why ſhould men that know not what it is to ſtudy, be forbidden to dig?</p>
               <p>Are they Laicks, becauſe they do not preach? Many we have in <hi>England</hi> who would think ſcorn to be termed Laicks, that never did preach, never had licence to preach.</p>
               <p>Are they Laicks becauſe they are not ordained by laying on of hands? It will be hard to prove that that ceremony is eſſential to make a man a Church-officer.</p>
               <p>But yet Mr. <hi>Scrivener</hi> hath good leave to fall upon theſe Ruling-Elders, to bring them into any Court by a <hi>Quo VVarranto;</hi> and if he do chance to caſt them, there be but few <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> that will be at coſt to bring the buſineſs to a new Trial. Theſe Elders in ſome places are made the more pert, becauſe of the multiplicity and variety of anſwers that the Prelatical give to thoſe places of Scripture on which their divine inſtitution is pretended to be built. It would tire an ordinary patience to reckon up the various ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions that are given of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17 <hi>Scultetus</hi> cenſures the anſwers given by <hi>Bilſon,</hi> another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the anſwer given by <hi>Scultetus;</hi> others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute all the anſwers given by Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi> Among all that have written againſt Elders, whether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned or learned, I have not met with any that have ſatisfied me (yet I can ſatisfie my ſelf) about this place. For thoſe Churches that argue heartily for theſe Elders, do argue from the general
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:105061:125"/>word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

In the mean time I beſeech him to commune with his own heart, and to conſider with what ſpirit he writ his books againſt <hi>Daillee</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts;</hi> by ſo doing he will be brought, I doubt not, to take ſhame unto himſelf, and ſo prevent the far greater ſhame of having his rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and calumnies laid open by others. <hi>Quod erat exorandum.</hi>
